[Horatio] Now cracks a noble heart!
Good night, sweet prince,
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
Why does the drum come hither?
Enter Fortinbras and English] Ambassador, with Drum,
Colors, and Attendants].
[Fortinbras] Where is this sight?
[Horatio] What is it ye would see?
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
[Fortinbras] His quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
That thou so many princes at a shoot
So bloodily hast struck?
[Ambassador] The sight is dismal,
And our affairs from England come too late.
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
To tell him his commandment is fulfilled,
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead,
Where should we have our thanks?
[Horatio] Not from his mouth,
Had it th'ability of life to thank you;
He never gave commandment for their death.
But since so jump upon this bloody question
You from the Polack wars and you from England
Are here arrived, give order that these bodies
High on a stage be plac√®d to the view,
And let me speak to th' yet unknowing world
How these things came about. So shall you hear
Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
Of deaths put on by cunning, and forced cause,
And in this upshot, purposes mistook
Fall'n on the inventors' heads. All this can I
Truly deliver.
[Fortinbras] Let us haste to hear it,
And call the noblest to the audience.
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
Which now to claim my vantage doth
Invite me.
[Horatio] Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
And from his mouth
Whose voice will draw on more.
But let this same be presently performed,
Even whiles men's minds are wild,
Lest more mischance
On plots and errors happen.
[Fortinbras] Let four captains
Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage,
For he was likely, had he been put on,
To have proved most royally;
And for his passage,
The soldiers' music and the rites of war
Speak loudly for him.
Take up the body. Such a sight as this
Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
Exeunt marching, after the which, a peal of
ordnance are shot off.
