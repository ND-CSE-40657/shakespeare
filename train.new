Actus Primus. Scena Prima.
Enter Barnardo and Francisco, two sentinels.
[Barnardo] Who's there?
[Francisco] Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold
yourself.
[Barnardo] Long live the King!
[Francisco] Barnardo?
[Barnardo] He.
[Francisco] You come most carefully upon your hour.
[Barnardo] 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco,
[Francisco] For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
And I am sick at heart.
[Barnardo] Have you had quiet guard?
[Francisco] Not a mouse stirring.
[Barnardo] Well, good night.If you do meet Horatio and
Marcellus, the rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
Enter Horatio and Marcellus.
[Francisco] I think I hear them.--Stand! Who's there?
[Horatio] Friends to this ground.
[Marcellus] And liegemen to the Dane.
[Francisco] Give you good night.
[Marcellus] Oh, farewell, honest soldier. Who hath relieved you?
[Francisco] Barnardo has my place. Give you good night.
Exit Francisco.
[Marcellus] Holla, Barnardo!
[Barnardo] Say, what, is Horatio there?
[Horatio] A piece of him.
[Barnardo] Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
[Horatio] What, has this thing appeared again tonight?
[Barnardo] I have seen nothing.
[Marcellus] Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
And will not let belief take hold of him,
Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us.
Therefore I have entreated him along
With us, to watch the minutes of this night,
That if again this apparition come
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
[Horatio] Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
[Barnardo] Sit down awhile,
And let us once again assail your ears,
That are so fortified against our story,
What we have two nights seen.
[Horatio] Well, sit we down,
And let us hear Barnardo speak of this.
[Barnardo] Last night of all,
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Had made his course t'illume that part of heaven
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
The bell then beating one--
Enter the Ghost. [Marcellus] Peace, break thee off!
Look where it comes again!
[Barnardo] In the same figure like the King that's dead.
[Marcellus] Thou art a scholar. Speak to it, Horatio.
[Barnardo] Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
[Horatio] Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
[Barnardo] It would be spoke to.
[Marcellus] Question it, Horatio.
[Horatio] What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
Together with that fair and warlike form
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Did sometimes march? By heaven, I charge thee speak!
[Marcellus] It is offended.
[Barnardo] See, it stalks away.
[Horatio] Stay, speak, speak, I charge thee, speak!
Exit the Ghost.
[Marcellus] 'Tis gone, and will not answer.
[Barnardo] How now, Horatio, you tremble and look pale.
Is not this something more then fantasy?
What think you on't?
[Horatio] Before my God, I might not this believe
Without the sensible and true avouch
Of mine own eyes.
[Marcellus] Is it not like the King?
[Horatio] As thou art to thyself.
Such was the very armor he had on
When he the ambitious Norway combated.
So frowned he once, when in an angry parle
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
'Tis strange.
[Marcellus] Thus twice before, and just at this dead hour,
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
[Horatio] In what particular thought to work I know not,
But in the gross and scope of mine opinion
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
[Marcellus] Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
Why this same strict and most observant watch
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
And with such daily cost of brazen cannon
And foreign mart for implements of war;
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
Doth make the night joint-laborer with the day?
Who is't that can inform me?
[Horatio] That can I.
At least the whisper goes so: our last King,
Whose image even but now appeared to us,
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
Thereto pricked on by a most emulate pride,
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
(For so this side of our known world esteemed him)
Did slay this Fortinbras, who by a sealed compact
Well ratified by law and heraldry
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Which he stood seized on, to the conqueror;
Against the which a moiety competent
Was gagèd by our King, which had returned
To the inheritance of Fortinbras
Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant
And carriage of the article design
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Of unimprovèd mettle, hot and full,
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Sharked up a list of lawless resolutes
For food and diet to some enterprise
That hath a stomach in't, which is no other,
As it doth well appear unto our state,
But to recover of us by strong hand
And terms compulsative those foresaid lands
So by his father lost. And this, I take it,
Is the main motive of our preparations,
The source of this our watch, and the chief head
Of this post-haste and rummage in the land.
Enter Ghost again.
But soft, behold, lo, where it comes again!
I'll cross it, though it blast me.--Stay, illusion!
If thou hast any sound or use of voice,
Speak to me! If there be any good thing to be done
That may to thee do ease and grace to me, Speak to me!
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
Which happily foreknowing may avoid, Oh, speak!
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
For which, they say, your spirits oft walk in death,
Speak of it. Stay and speak!--Stop it, Marcellus!
[Marcellus] Shall I strike it with my partisan?
[Horatio] Do, if it will not stand.
[Barnardo] 'Tis here.
[Horatio] 'Tis here.
[Marcellus] 'Tis gone. Exit Ghost.
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
To offer it the show of violence,
For it is as the air, invulnerable,
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
[Barnardo] It was about to speak when the cock crew.
[Horatio] And then it started like a guilty thing
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
The cock, that is the trumpet to the day,
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
Awake the god of day, and, at his warning,
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
Th'extravagant and erring spirit hies
To his confine; and of the truth herein
This present object made probation.
[Marcellus] It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
Wherein our Savior's birth is celebrated,
The bird of dawning singeth all night long,
And then, they say, no spirit can walk abroad;
The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
No fairy talks, nor witch hath power to charm,
So hallowed and so gracious is the time.
[Horatio] So have I heard, and do in part believe it.
But look, the morn in russet mantle clad
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
Break we our watch up, and by my advice
Let us impart what we have seen tonight
Unto young Hamlet, for, upon my life,
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
[Marcellus] Let's do 't, I pray, and I this morning know
Where we shall find him most conveniently. Exeunt.
Scena Secunda.
Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen,
Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, and his sister
Ophelia, Lords attendant.
[Claudius] Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
That we with wisest sorrow think on him
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
Therefore our sometimes sister, now our queen,
Th'imperial jointress to this warlike state,
Have we, as 'twere, with a defeated joy,
With an auspicious and one dropping eye,
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
Taken to wife. Nor have we herein barred
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
Now follows that you know: young Fortinbras,
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
Co-leaguèd with the dream of his advantage,
He hath not failed to pester us with message
Importing the surrender of those lands
Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
Enter Voltemand and Cornelius.
Now for ourself, and for this time of meeting,
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
His further gate herein, in that the levies,
The lists, and full proportions are all made
Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,
Giving to you no further personal power
To business with the King more than the scope
Of these delated articles allow.
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
[Voltemand] In that and all things will we show our duty.
[Claudius] We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
Exit Voltemand and Cornelius.
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
The head is not more native to the heart,
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
[Laertes] My dread lord,
Your leave and favor to return to France,
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
To show my duty in your coronation,
Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
[Claudius] Have you your father's leave?
What says Polonius?
[Polonius] He hath, my lord.
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
[Claudius] Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
And thy best graces spend it at thy will.
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son--
[Hamlet] A little more than kin, and less than kind.
[Claudius] How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
[Hamlet] Not so, my lord, I am too much i'th' sun.
[Gertrude] Good Hamlet, cast thy nightly color off
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
Do not forever with thy vailèd lids
Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
Thou know'st 'tis common: all that lives must die,
Passing through nature to eternity.
[Hamlet] Ay, madam, it is common.
[Gertrude] If it be,
Why seems it so particular with thee?
[Hamlet] "Seems," madam? Nay, it is, I know not "seems."
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
Together with all forms, moods, shows of grief
That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
For they are actions that a man might play.
But I have that within which passeth show;
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
[Claudius] 'Tis sweet and commendable
in your nature, Hamlet,
To give these mourning duties to your father.
But you must know your father lost a father;
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
In filial obligation for some term
To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
In obstinate condolement is a course
Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief.
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
An understanding simple and unschooled;
For what we know must be and is as common
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
Why should we in our peevish opposition
Take it to heart? Fie, 'tis a fault to heaven,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
To reason most absurd, whose common theme
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried
From the first corse till he that died today
"This must be so." We pray you throw to earth
This unprevailing woe, and think of us
As of a father; for let the world take note
You are the most immediate to our throne,
And with no less nobility of love
Than that which dearest father bears his son
Do I impart towards you. For your intent
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
It is most retrograde to our desire,
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
[Gertrude] Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
I prithee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
[Hamlet] I shall in all my best
obey you, madam.
[Claudius] Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
Be as ourself in Denmark.--Madam, come.
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
Sits smiling to my heart, in grace whereof
No jocund health that Denmark drinks today
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
Respeaking earthly thunder. Come, away! Exeunt.
Manet Hamlet.
[Hamlet] Oh, that this too too solid flesh would melt,
Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
Or that the everlasting had not fixed
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! Oh, God, God,
How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
Fie on't! Oh, fie, fie, 'tis an unweeded garden
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
But two months dead--nay, not so much, not two!
So excellent a king, that was to this
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth,
Must I remember? Why, she should hang on him
As if increase of appetite had grown
By what it fed on. And yet within a month--
Let me not think on't; frailty, thy name is woman!
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
With which she followed my poor father's body,
Like Niobe, all tears, why, she, even she--
Oh, heaven! a beast that wants discourse of reason
Would have mourned longer!--married with mine uncle,
My father's brother, but no more like my father
Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
Had left the flushing of her gallèd eyes,
She married. Oh, most wicked speed, to post
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
It is not, nor it cannot come to good,
But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue.
Enter Horatio, Barnardo, and Marcellus.
[Horatio] Hail to your lordship!
[Hamlet] I am glad to see you well.--
Horatio, or I do forget myself!
[Horatio] The same, my lord,
and your poor servant ever.
[Hamlet] Sir, my good friend,
I'll change that name with you.
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?--
Marcellus.
[Marcellus] My good lord.
[Hamlet] I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
[Horatio] A truant disposition, good my lord.
[Hamlet] I would not have your enemy say so,
Nor shall you do my ear that violence
To make it truster of your own report
Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
[Horatio] My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
[Hamlet] I pray thee do not mock me, fellow student.
I think it was to my mother's wedding.
[Horatio] Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
[Hamlet] Thrift, thrift, Horatio. The funeral baked meats
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Ere I had ever seen that day, Horatio!
My father--methinks I see my father.
[Horatio] Oh, where, my lord?
[Hamlet] In my mind's eye, Horatio.
[Horatio] I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
[Hamlet] He was a man. Take him for all in all,
I shall not look upon his like again.
[Horatio] My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
[Hamlet] Saw? Who?
[Horatio] My lord, the King your father.
[Hamlet] The King my father?
[Horatio] Season your admiration for a while
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
This marvel to you.
[Hamlet] For heaven's love, let me hear!
[Horatio] Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Marcellus and Barnardo, on their watch
In the dead waste and middle of the night
Been thus encountered: a figure like your father
Armed at point, exactly, cap-à-pie,
Appears before them, and with solemn march
Goes slow and stately. By them thrice he walked,
By their oppressed and fear-surprisèd eyes
Within his truncheon's length, whilst they, distilled
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
And I with them the third night kept the watch,
Where, as they had delivered, both in time,
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
The apparition comes. I knew your father.
These hands are not more like.
[Hamlet] But where was this?
[Marcellus] My lord, upon the platform where we watched,
[Hamlet] Did you not speak to it?
[Horatio] My lord, I did,
But answer made it none. Yet once methought
It lifted up it head and did address
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
And vanished from our sight.
[Hamlet] 'Tis very strange.
[Horatio] As I do live, my honored lord, 'tis true,
And we did think it writ down in our duty
To let you know of it.
[Hamlet] Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
Hold you the watch tonight?
[Both] We do, my lord.
[Hamlet] Armed, say you?
[Both] Armed, my lord.
[Hamlet] From top to toe?
[Both] My lord, from head to foot.
[Hamlet] Then saw you not his face?
[Horatio] Oh, yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up.
[Hamlet] What, looked he frowningly?
[Horatio] A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
[Hamlet] Pale, or red?
[Horatio] Nay, very pale.
[Hamlet] And fixed his eyes upon you?
[Horatio] Most constantly.
[Hamlet] I would I had been there.
[Horatio] It would have much amazed you.
[Hamlet] Very like, very like. Stayed it long?
[Horatio] While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
[Marcellus; Bernardo] Longer, longer.
[Horatio] Not when I saw't.
[Hamlet] His beard was grizzly? No?
[Horatio] It was, as I have seen it in his life,
A sable silvered. 
[Hamlet] I'll watch tonight. Perchance 'twill wake again.
[Horatio] I warrant you it will.
[Hamlet] If it assume my noble father's person,
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
If you have hitherto concealed this sight
Let it be treble in your silence still,
And whatsoever else shall hap tonight,
Give it an understanding but no tongue;
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
Upon the platform 'twixt eleven and twelve
I'll visit you.
[All] Our duty to your honor. Exeunt.
[Hamlet] Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
My father's spirit in arms! All is not well.
I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
Till then, sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes. Exit.
Scena Tertia.
Enter Laertes and Ophelia.
[Laertes] My necessaries are imbarked. Farewell.
And sister, as the winds give benefit
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep
But let me hear from you.
[Ophelia] Do you doubt that?
[Laertes] For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favors,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
The suppliance of a minute, no more.
[Ophelia] No more but so?
[Laertes] Think it no more.
For nature crescent does not grow alone
In thews and bulk, but as this temple waxes
The inward service of the mind and soul
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
His greatness weighed, his will is not his own,
For he himself is subject to his birth.
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
The sanctity and health of the whole state,
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
As he in his peculiar sect and force
May give his saying deed, which is no further
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
Then weigh what loss your honor may sustain,
If with too credent ear you list his songs,
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
To his unmastered importunity.
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
And keep within the rear of your affection,
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
The chariest maid is prodigal enough
If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
Virtue itself scapes not calumnious strokes.
The canker galls the infants of the spring
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Be wary, then; best safety lies in fear.
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
[Ophelia] I shall th'effect of this good lesson keep
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
Whiles, like a puffed and reckless libertine,
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
And recks not his own rede.
[Laertes] Oh, fear me not.
Enter Polonius.
I stay too long. But here my father comes.
A double blessing, is a double grace;
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
[Polonius] Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
And you are stayed for there. My blessing with you,
And these few precepts in thy memory
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel,
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Of each unhatched, unfledged comrade. Beware
Of entrance to a quarrel, but, being in,
Bear't that th'opposèd may beware of thee.
Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice.
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
But not expressed in fancy--rich, not gaudy,
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
And they in France of the best rank and station
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
Neither a borrower nor a lender be,
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
This above all; to thine own self be true,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
[Laertes] Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
[Polonius] The time invites you. Go. Your servants tend.
[Laertes] Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
What I have said to you.
[Ophelia] 'Tis in my memory locked,
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
[Laertes] Farewell. Exit Laertes.
[Polonius] What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
[Ophelia] So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
[Polonius] Marry, well bethought
'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
Given private time to you, and you yourself
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
If it be so--as so 'tis put on me,
And that in way of caution--I must tell you
You do not understand yourself so clearly
As it behooves my daughter and your honor.
What is between you? Give me up the truth.
[Ophelia] He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
Of his affection to me.
[Polonius] Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
Do you believe his "tenders," as you call them?
[Ophelia] I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
[Polonius] Marry, I'll teach you. Think yourself a baby
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase
Roaming it thus--you'll tender me a fool.
[Ophelia] My lord, he hath importuned me with love
In honorable fashion.
[Polonius] Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to.
[Ophelia] And hath given countenance to his speech,
My lord, with almost all the vows of heaven.
[Polonius] Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
Gives the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
Even in their promise as it is a-making ,
You must not take for fire. For this time, daughter,
Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
Set your entreatments at a higher rate
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
Believe so much in him that he is young,
And with a larger tether may he walk
Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
Do not believe his vows, for they are brokers
Not of that dye which their investments show,
But mere implorators of unholy suits
Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds
The better to beguile. This is for all:
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
Have you so slander any moment leisure
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
[Ophelia] I shall obey, my lord. Exeunt.
Enter Hamlet, Horatio, Marcellus.
[Hamlet] The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
[Horatio] It is nipping and an eager air.
[Hamlet] What hour now?
[Horatio] I think it lacks of twelve.
[Marcellus] No, it is struck.
[Horatio] Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
What does this mean, my lord?
[Hamlet] The King doth wake tonight, and takes his rouse,
Keeps wassails, and the swaggering upspring reels;
And as he drains his drafts of Rhenish down
The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
The triumph of his pledge.
[Horatio] Is it a custom?
[Hamlet] Ay, marry is't,
But to my mind, though I am native here
And to the manner born, it is a custom
More honored in the breach than the observance.
Enter Ghost.
[Horatio] Look, my lord, it comes.
[Hamlet] Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned,
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
Be thy events wicked or charitable,
Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
King, father, royal Dane. Oh, oh, answer me!
Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
Why thy canonized bones, hearsèd in death,
Have burst their cerements, why the sepulcher
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurned
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws
To cast thee up again? What may this mean
That thou, dead corse, again in compleat steel
Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
So horridly to shake our disposition
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
Say, why is this? Wherefore? What should we do?
Ghost beckons Hamlet.
[Horatio] It beckons you to go away with it,
As if it some impartment did desire
To you alone.
[Marcellus] Look with what courteous action
It waves you to a more removèd ground.
But do not go with it.
[Horatio] No, by no means.
[Hamlet] It will not speak. Then I will follow it.
[Horatio] Do not, my lord.
[Hamlet] Why, what should be the fear?
I do not set my life at a pin's fee,
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
Being a thing immortal as itself?
It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
[Horatio] What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
And there assume some other horrible form
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
And draw you into madness? Think of it.
[Hamlet] It wafts me still.--Go on, I'll follow thee.
[Marcellus] You shall not go, my lord.
[Hamlet] Hold off your hand!
[Horatio] Be ruled. You shall not go.
[Hamlet] My fate cries out
And makes each petty artery in this body
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
Still am I called. Unhand me, gentlemen!
By heav'n, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me.
I say, away!--Go on, I'll follow thee.
Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
[Horatio] He waxes desperate with imagination.
[Marcellus] Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
[Horatio] Have after. To what issue will this come?
[Marcellus] Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
[Horatio] Heaven will direct it.
[Marcellus] Nay, let's follow him. Exeunt.
Enter Ghost and Hamlet.
[Hamlet] Where wilt thou lead me? Speak. I'll go no further.
[Ghost] Mark me.
[Hamlet] I will.
[Ghost] My hour is almost come
When I to sulfurous and tormenting flames
Must render up myself.
[Hamlet] Alas, poor ghost!
[Ghost] Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
To what I shall unfold.
[Hamlet] Speak. I am bound to hear.
[Ghost] So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
[Hamlet] What?
[Ghost] I am thy father's spirit,
Doomed for a certain term to walk the night,
And for the day confined to fast in fires,
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
To tell the secrets of my prison house,
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres,
Thy knotted and combinèd locks to part,
And each particular hair to stand an end
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
But this eternal blazon must not be
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, oh, list:
If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
[Hamlet] O heaen!
[Ghost] Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
[Hamlet] Murder?
[Ghost] Murder most foul, as in the best it is,
But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
[Hamlet] Haste, haste me to know't,
that with wings as swift
As meditation, or the thoughts of love,
May sweep to my revenge.
[Ghost] I find thee apt,
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
'Tis given out that, sleeping in mine orchard,
A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
Is by a forgèd process of my death
Rankly abused. But know, thou noble youth,
The serpent that did sting thy father's life
Now wears his crown.
[Hamlet] Oh, my prophetic soul! Mine uncle?
[Ghost] Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
With witchcraft of his wits, with traitorous gifts--
Oh, wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
The will of my most seeming virtuous queen.
Oh, Hamlet, what a falling off was there!
From me, whose love was of that dignity
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
I made to her in marriage, and to decline
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
To those of mine. But virtue, as it never will be moved,
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
So lust, though to a radiant angel linked,
Will sate itself in a celestial bed And prey on garbage.
But soft, methinks I scent the morning air.
Brief let me be. Sleeping within mine orchard,
My custom always in the afternoon,
Upon my secure hour, thy uncle stole
With juice of cursèd hebenon in a vial,
And in the porches of mine ears did pour
The leperous distilment, whose effect
Holds such an enmity with blood of man
That swift as quicksilver it courses through
The natural gates and alleys of the body,
And with a sudden vigor it doth posset
And curd like eager droppings into milk
The thin and wholesome blood; so did it mine,
And a most instant tetter baked about
Most lazarlike with vile and loathsome crust
All my smooth body.
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
Of life, of crown, of queen at once dispatched,
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
Unhousled, disappointed, unaneled,
No reckoning made, but sent to my account
With all my imperfections on my head.
Oh, horrible, oh, horrible, most horrible!
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
A couch for luxury and damnèd incest.
But howsoever thou pursuest this act,
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
Against thy mother aught; leave her to heaven
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire,.
Adieu, adieu, Hamlet! Remember me. Exit.
[Hamlet] Oh, all you host of heaven 1 Oh, earth! What else?
And shall I couple hell? Oh, fie! Hold, my heart,
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
But bear me swiftly up. Remember thee?
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
Yea, from the table of my memory
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
That youth and observation copied there,
And thy commandment all alone shall live
Within the book and volume of my brain,
Unmixed with baser matter. Yes, by heaven.
Oh, most pernicious woman!
Oh, villain, villain, smiling damnèd villain!
My tables, my tables--meet it is I set it down,
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain.
At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word.
It is "Adieu, adieu, remember me." I have sworn't.
[Horatio; Marclellus] My lord, my lord!
Enter Horatio and Marcellus.
[Marcellus] Lord Hamlet!
[Horatio] Heaven secure him!
[Marcellus] So be it.
[Horatio] Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
[Hamlet] Hillo, ho, ho, boy, come, and come! 1
[Marcellus] How is't, my noble lord?
[Horatio] What news, my lord?
[Hamlet] Oh, wonderful!
[Horatio] Good my lord, tell it.
[Hamlet] No, you'll reveal it.
[Horatio] Not I, my lord, by heaven.
[Marcellus] Nor I, my lord.
[Hamlet] How say you then, would heart of man once think it?
But you'll be secret?
[Horatio; Marcellus] Ay, by heaven, my lord.
[Hamlet] There's ne'er a villain Dwelling in all Denmark
But he's an arrant knave.
[Horatio] There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave,
To tell us this.
[Hamlet] Why, right, you are i'th' right.
And so, without more circumstance at all,
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
You as your business and desire shall point you
(For every man has business and desire,
Such as it is), and for mine own poor part,
Look you, I'll go pray.
[Horatio] These are but wild and hurling words, my lord.
[Hamlet] I'm sorry they offend you--heartily,
Yes, faith, heartily.
[Horatio] There's no offense, my lord.
[Hamlet] Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, my lord,
And much offense too. Touching this vision here,
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
For your desire to know what is between us,
O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
Give me one poor request.
[Horatio] What is't, my lord? We will.
[Hamlet] Never make known what you have seen tonight.
[Horatio; Marcellus] My lord, we will not.
[Hamlet] Nay, but swear't.
[Horatio] In faith, my lord, not I.
[Marcellus] Nor I, my lord, in faith.
[Hamlet] Upon my sword.
[Marcellus] We have sworn, my lord, already.
[Hamlet] Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
Ghost cries under the stage. [Ghost] Swear.
[Hamlet] Aha, boy, sayest thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?--
Come on, you hear this fellow in the cellarage?
Consent to swear.
[Horatio] Propose the oath, my lord.
[Hamlet] Never to speak of this that you have seen.
Swear by my sword.
[Ghost] Swear.
[Hamlet] Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
Come hither, gentlemen,
And lay your hands again upon my sword.
Never to speak of this that you have heard.
Swear by my sword.
[Ghost] Swear.
[Hamlet] Well said, old mole. Canst work i'th' ground so fast?
A worthy pioneer!--Once more remove, good friends.
[Horatio] Oh, day and night, but this is wondrous strange.
[Hamlet] And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
Than are dreamt of in our philosophy. But come,
Here as before: never, so help you mercy,
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
(As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
To put an antic disposition on),
That you at such time seeing me never shall,
With arms encumbered thus, or thus headshake,
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase
As, "Well, we know," or "We could an if we would,"
Or "If we list to speak," or "There be an if they might,"
Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
That you know aught of me. This not to do,
So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
Swear.
[Ghost] Swear.
[Hamlet] Rest, rest, perturbèd spirit. So, gentlemen,
With all my love I do commend me to you,
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
May do t'express his love and friending to you,
God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together,
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
The time is out of joint. Oh, cursèd spite,
That ever I was born to set it right!
Nay come, let's go together. Exeunt.
Actus Secundus.
Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.
[Polonius] Give him his money, and these notes, Reynaldo.
[Reynaldo] I will, my lord.
[Polonius] You shall do marvelous wisely, good Reynaldo,
Before you visit him, to make inquiry
Of his behavior.
[Reynaldo] My lord, I did intend it.
[Polonius] Marry, well said.
Very well said. Look you, sir,
Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris,
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
What company, at what expense; and finding
By this encompassment and drift of question
That they do know my son, come you more nearer
Than your particular demands will touch it;
Take you as 'twere some distant knowledge of him,
As thus, "I know his father and his friends,
And in part him." Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
[Reynaldo] Ay, very well, my lord.
[Polonius] "And in part him. But," you may say, "not well,
But if't be he I mean, he's very wild,
Addicted so and so," and there put on him
What forgeries you please--marry, none so rank
As may dishonor him, take heed of that,
But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
As are companions noted and most known
To youth and liberty.
[Reynaldo] As gaming, my lord.
[Polonius] Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing,
Quarreling, drabbing--you may go so far.
[Reynaldo] My lord, that would dishonor him.
[Polonius] Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
You must not put another scandal on him
That he is open to incontinency;
That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
That they may seem the taints of liberty,
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
A savageness in unreclaimed blood, Of general assault.
[Reynaldo] But, my good lord--
[Polonius] Wherefore should you do this?
[Reynaldo] Ay, my lord, I would know that.
[Polonius] Marry sir, here's my drift,
And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
You laying these slight sallies on my son
As 'twere a thing a little soiled i'th' working,
Mark you, your party in converse, him you would sound,
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
He closes with you in this consequence:
"Good sir" (or so), or "friend," or "gentleman,"
According to the phrase, or the addition
Of man and country.
[Reynaldo] Very good, my lord.
[Polonius] And then, sir, does he this,
He does--what was I about to say?
I was about to say something. Where did I leave?
[Reynaldo] At "closes in the consequence,"
At "friend" (or so), and "gentleman."
[Polonius] At "closes in the consequence." Ay, marry,
He closes with you thus: "I know the gentleman,
I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
Or then, or then, with such and such, and as you say,
There was he gaming, there o'ertook in's rouse,
There falling out at tennis," or perchance
"I saw him enter such a house of sale,"
Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth. See you now,
Your bait of falsehood take this carp of truth,
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
With windlasses and with assays of bias,
By indirections find directions out;
So by my former lecture and advice
Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
[Reynaldo] My lord, I have.
[Polonius] God buy you; fare ye well.
[Reynaldo] Good my lord.
[Polonius] Observe his inclination in yourself.
[Reynaldo] I shall, my lord.
[Polonius] And let him ply his music.
[Reynaldo] Well, my lord. Exit.
Enter Ophelia.
[Polonius] Farewell.
How now Ophelia, what's the matter?
[Ophelia] Alas, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
[Polonius] With what, in the name of heaven?
[Ophelia] My lord, as I was sewing in my chamber,
Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced,
No hat upon his head, his stockings fouled,
Ungartered, and down-gyvèd to his ankle,
Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
And with a look so piteous in purport
As if he had been loosèd out of hell
To speak of horrors, he comes before me.
[Polonius] Mad for thy love?
[Ophelia] My lord, I do not know,But truly I do fear it.
[Polonius] What said he?
[Ophelia] He took me by the wrist, and held me hard.
Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
And with his other hand thus o'er his brow
He falls to such perusal of my face
As he would draw it. Long stayed he so.
At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
That it did seem to shatter all his bulk
And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
And with his head over his shoulder turned
He seemed to find his way without his eyes,
For out o'doors he went without their help,
And to the last bended their light on me.
[Polonius] Come, go with me. I will go seek the King,
This is the very ecstasy of love,
Whose violent property fordoes itself
And leads the will to desperate undertakings
As oft as any passions under heaven
That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
What, have you given him any hard words of late?
[Ophelia] No, my good lord, but as you did command
I did repel his letters, and denied
His access to me.
[Polonius] That hath made him mad.
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
I had not quoted him. I fear he did but trifle
And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
It seems it is as proper to our age
To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
As it is common for the younger sort
To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
This must be known, which, being kept close, might move
More grief to hide than hate to utter love. Exeunt.
Scena Secunda.
Enter King, Queen, Rosencrantz, and Guilden-
stern cum aliis.
[Claudius] Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
Moreover that we much did long to see you,
The need we have to use you did provoke
Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
Of Hamlet's transformation--so call it,
Sith not th'exterior nor the inward man
Resembles that it was. What it should be,
More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
So much from th'understanding of himself,
I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
That, being of so young days brought up with him,
And since so neighbored to his youth and humor,
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
Some little time, so by your companies
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
So much as from occasion you may glean,
That opened lies within our remedy.
[Gertrude] Good gentlemen, he hath much talked of you,
And sure I am two men there are not living
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
To show us so much gentry and good will
As to expend your time with us awhile
For the supply and profit of our hope,
Your visitation shall receive such thanks
As fits a king's remembrance.
[Rosencrantz] Both your majesties
Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
Put your dread pleasures more into command
Than to entreaty.
[Guildenstern] We both obey,
And here give up ourselves in the full bent
To lay our services freely at your feet
To be commanded.
[Claudius] Thanks, Rosencrantz, and gentle Guildenstern.
[Gertrude] Thanks, Guildenstern, and gentle Rosencrantz.
And I beseech you instantly to visit
My too-much-changèd son.--
Go, some of ye,
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
[Guildenstern] Heavens make our presence and our practices
Pleasant and helpful to him! Exit.
[Gertrude] Ay, amen.
Enter Polonius.
[Polonius] Th'ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
Are joyfully returned.
[Claudius] Thou still hast been the father of good news.
[Polonius] Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege
I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
Both to my God and to my gracious king;
And I do think, or else this brain of mine
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
As it have used to do, that I have found
The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
[Claudius] Oh, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
[Polonius] Give first admittance to th'ambassadors.
My news shall be the news to that great feast.
[Claudius] Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.--
He tells me, my sweet Queen, that he hath found
The head and source of all your son's distemper.
[Gertrude] I doubt it is no other but the main:
His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.
Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.
[Claudius] Well, we shall sift him.--Welcome, good friends.
Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
[Voltemand] Most fair return of greetings and desires.
Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
His nephew's levies, which to him appeared
To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,
But, better looked into, he truly found
It was against your highness; whereat grieved
That so his sickness, age, and impotence
Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
On Fortinbras, which he in brief obeys,
Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
Makes vow before his uncle never more
To give th'assay of arms against your majesty.
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
Gives him threescore thousand crowns in annual fee
And his commission to employ those soldiers
So levied, as before, against the Polack,
With an entreaty herein further shown
That it might please you to give quiet pass
Through your dominions for this enterprise
On such regards of safety and allowance
As therein are set down.
[Claudius] It likes us well,
And at our more considered time we'll read,
Answer, and think upon this business.
Meantime, we thank you for your well-took labor.
Go to your rest. At night we'll feast together.
Most welcome home! Exit Ambassadors.
[Polonius] This business is well ended.
My liege and madam, to expostulate
What majesty should be, what duty is,
Why day is day, night, night, and time is time,
Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes.
I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
Mad call I it, for to define true madness,
What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
But let that go.
[Gertrude] More matter, with less art.
[Polonius] Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
That he's mad, 'tis true, 'Tis true 'tis pity,
And pity it is true--a foolish figure,
But farewell it, for I will use no art.
Mad let us grant him, then. And now remains
That we find out the cause of this effect,
Or rather say the cause of this defect,
For this effect defective comes by cause.
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend,
I have a daughter--have whilst she is mine--
Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
Hath given me this. Now gather and surmise.
The letter.
"To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most beautified
Ophelia."
That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; "beautified" is a vile in
phrase. But you shall hear: "these in her excellent white
bosom, these."
[Gertrude] Came this from Hamlet to her?
[Polonius] Good madam, stay awhile, I will be faithful.
"Doubt thou the stars are fire,
Doubt that the sun doth move,
Doubt truth to be a liar,
But never doubt I love.
Oh, dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers. I have not art to
reckon my groans. But that I love thee best, oh, most best,
believe it. Adieu.
Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this
Machine is to him, Hamlet.
This in obedience hath my daughter showed me,
And more above hath his solicitings,
As they fell out, by time, by means, and place,
All given to mine ear.
[Claudius] But how hath she received his love?
[Polonius] What do you think of me?
[Claudius] As of a man faithful and honorable.
[Polonius] I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
When I had seen this hot love on the wing--
As I perceived it (I must tell you that)
Before my daughter told me--what might you,
Or my dear majesty your queen here, think
If I had played the desk or table-book,
Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
Or looked upon this love with idle sight,
What might you think? No, I went round to work,
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
"Lord Hamlet is a prince out of thy star.
This must not be." And then I precepts gave her
That she should lock herself from his resort,
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
And he, repulsèd, a short tale to make,
Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
Thence to a lightness, and by this declension
Into the madness wherein now he raves,
And all we mourn for.
[Claudius] Do you think 'tis this?
[Gertrude] It may be, very likely.
[Polonius] Hath there been such a time--I would fain know that--
That I have positively said 'tis so
When it proved otherwise?
[Claudius] Not that I know.
[Polonius] Take this from this, if this be otherwise.
If circumstances lead me, I will find
Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
Within the center.
[Claudius] How may we try it further?
[Polonius] You know sometimes
he walks four hours together here
In the lobby.
[Gertrude] So he has indeed.
[Polonius] At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
Be you and I behind an arras then,
Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
Let me be no assistant for a state
But keep a farm and carters.
[Claudius] We will try it.
Enter Hamlet reading on a book.
[Gertrude] But look where sadly the poor wretch
comes reading.
[Polonius] Away, I do beseech you, both away.
I'll board him presently. Exit King and Queen.
Oh, give me leave.--How does my good Lord Hamlet?
[Hamlet] Well, God-a-mercy.
[Polonius] Do you know me, my lord?
[Hamlet] Excellent well. Y'are a fishmonger.
[Polonius] Not I, my lord.
[Hamlet] Then I would you were so honest a man.
[Polonius] Honest, my lord?
[Hamlet] Ay, sir, to be honest as this world goes is to be
one man picked out of two thousand.
[Polonius] That's very true, my lord.
[Hamlet] For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog,
being a good kissing carrion--
Have you a daughter?
[Polonius] I have, my lord.
[Hamlet] Let her not walk i'th' sun. Conception is a
blessing, but not as your daughter may conceive, friend,
look to't.
[Polonius] How say you by that? Still harping on my
daughter. Yet he knew me not at first. He said I was a
fishmonger. He is far gone, far gone. And truly, in my youth
I suffered much extremity for love, very near this. I'll
speak to him again.--What do you read, my lord?
[Hamlet] Words, words, words.
[Polonius] What is the matter, my lord?
[Hamlet] Between who?
[Polonius] I mean the matter that you read, my lord.
[Hamlet] Slanders sir; for the satirical rogue says here
that old men have gray beards, that their faces are
wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber or plumtree
gum, and that they have a plentiful lack of wit,
together with weak hams--all which, sir though I
most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it
not honesty to have it thus set down; for you
yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if, like a crab, you could
go backward.
[Polonius] Though this be madness,
yet there is method in't,--Will you walk
out of the air, my lord?
[Hamlet] Into my grave?
[Polonius] Indeed, that is out of the air.
How pregnant sometimes his replies are!
A happiness
that often madness hits on,
which reason and sanity could not
so prosperously be delivered of.
I will leave him,
and suddenly contrive the means of meeting
between him and my daughter.--
My honorable lord, I will most humbly
take my leave of you.
[Hamlet] You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I
will more willingly part withal-- except my life, my
life.
[Polonius] Fare you well, my lord.
[Hamlet] These tedious old fools!
[Polonius] You go to seek the Lord Hamlet? There
he is.
Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
[Rosencrantz] God save you, sir.
[Guildenstern] My honored lord!
[Rosencrantz] My most dear lord!
[Hamlet] My excellent good friends! How dost thou,
Guildenstern? Oh, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye
both?
[Rosencrantz] As the indifferent children of the earth.
[Guildenstern] Happy in that we are not over-happy. On
Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
[Hamlet] Nor the soles of her shoe?
[Rosencrantz] Neither, my lord.
[Hamlet] Then you live about her waist, or in the
middle of her favor?
[Guildenstern] Faith, her privates we.
[Hamlet] In the secret parts of Fortune? Oh, most true,
she is a strumpet. What's the news?
[Rosencrantz] None, my lord, but that the world's grown
honest.
[Hamlet] Then is doomsday near. But your news is
not true. Let me question more in paritcular: what have
you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of Fortune
that she sends you to prison hither?
[Guildenstern] Prison, my lord?
[Hamlet] Denmark's a prison.
[Rosencrantz] Then is the world one.
[Hamlet] A goodly one, in which there are many
confines, wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o'th'
worst.
[Rosencrantz] We think not so, my lord.
[Hamlet] Why, then 'tis none to you, for there is nothing
either good or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is
a prison.
[Rosencrantz] Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis
too narrow for your mind.
[Hamlet] Oh, God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and
count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that
I have bad dreams.
[Guildenstern] Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the
very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow
of a dream.
[Hamlet] A dream itself is but a shadow.
[Rosencrantz] Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and
light a quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.
[Hamlet] Then are our beggars bodies, and our
monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows.
Shall we to th' court? For, by my fay, I cannot rea-
son.
[Rosencrantz; Guildenstern] We'll wait upon you.
[Hamlet] No such matter. I will not sort you with the
rest of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest
man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the beaten
way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?
[Rosencrantz] To visit you my lord, no other occasion.
[Hamlet] Beggar that I am, I am ever poor in thanks,
but I thank you; and sure, dear friends, my thanks
are too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it
your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
deal justly with me. Come, come, nay, speak.
[Guildenstern] What should we say, my lord?
[Hamlet] Why, anything. But to the purpose: you were
sent for, and there is a kind of confession in your looks,
which your modesties have craft enough to
color. I know the good King and Queen have sent for you.
[Rosencrantz] To what end, my lord?
[Hamlet] That you must teach me. But let me conjure
you, by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved love,
and by what more dear a better proposer can charge
you withal, be even and direct with me whether you
were sent for or no.
[Rosencrantz] What say you?
[Hamlet] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you love me,
hold not off.
[Guildenstern] My lord, we were sent for.
[Hamlet] I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the King and
Queen molt no feather. I have of late, but wherefore
I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of ex-
ercise; and indeed it goes so heavily with my dispositi-
on that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a ster-
ile promontory. This most excellent canopy the air,
look you, this brave o'erhanging, this majestical roof
fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing
to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of
vapors. What a piece of work is a man! How noble in
reason! How infinite in faculty! In form and moving
how express and admirable! In action, how like an
angel! In apprehension, how like a god! The beauty of the
world, the paragon of animals. And yet to me what is
this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me, no,
nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem
to say so.
[Rosencrantz] My lord, there was no such stuff in my
thoughts.
[Hamlet] Why did you laugh, then, when I said man delights
not me?
[Rosencrantz] To think, my lord, if you delight not in man,
what lenten entertainment the players shall receive
from you. We coted them on the way, and hither are
they coming to offer you service.
[Hamlet] He that plays the King shall be welcome; his
majesty shall have tribute on me. The Adventurous
Knight shall use his foil and target, the Lover shall
not sigh gratis, the Humorous Man shall end his part in
peace, the Clown shall make those laugh whose lungs
are tickled o'th' sear, and the Lady shall say her mind
freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players the
are they?
[Rosencrantz] Even those you were wont to take such delight in,
the tragedians of the city.
[Hamlet] How chances it they travel? Their
residence both in reputation and profit was better both
ways.
[Rosencrantz] I think their inhibition comes by the means
of the late innovation.
[Hamlet] Do they hold the same estimation they did
when I was in the city? Are they so followed?
[Rosencrantz] No, indeed, are they not.
[Hamlet] How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
[Rosencrantz] Nay, their endeavor keeps in the wonted
pace. But there is, sir, an eyrie of children, little
eyases, that cry out on the top of question, and
are most tyrannically clapped for't. These are now the
fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they
call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of
goose quills and dare scarce come thither.
[Hamlet] What, are they children? Who maintains 'em?
How are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no
longer than they can sing? Will they not say afterwards,
if they should grow themselves to common players--as
it is most like if their means are not better--their
writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their
own succession?
[Rosencrantz] Faith, there has been much to-do on both sides,
and the nation holds it no sin to tar them to
controversy. There was for a while no money bid for
argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs on
the question.
[Hamlet] Is't possible?
[Guildenstern] Oh, there has been much throwing about of
brains.
[Hamlet] Do the boys carry it away?
[Rosencrantz] Ay, that they do, my lord, Hercules and his load too.
[Hamlet] It is not strange, for mine uncle is King of
Denmark, and those that would make mows at him
while my father lived give twenty, forty, fifty, an hundred
ducats apiece for his picture in little. There is
something in this more than natural, if philosophy could
find it out.
Flourish for the players.
[Guildenstern] There are the players.
[Hamlet] Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your
hands, come. Th'appurtenance of welcome is fashion
and ceremony. Let me comply with you in the garb,
lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you, must show
fairly outward, should more appear like entertainment
than yours. You are welcome. But my uncle-father
and aunt-mother are deceived.
[Guildenstern] In what, my dear lord?
[Hamlet] I am but mad north-north-west; when the
wind is southerly, I know a hawk from a hand saw.
Enter Polonius.
[Polonius] Well be with you, gentlemen.
[Hamlet] Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too, at each
ear a hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet
out of his swathing clouts.
[Rosencrantz] Happily he's the second time come to them, for
they say an old man is twice a child.
[Hamlet] I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the
players. Mark it.--You say right, sir, o'Monday
morning, 'twas so indeed.
[Polonius] My lord, I have news to tell you.
[Hamlet] My lord, I have news to tell you.
When Roscius was an actor in Rome--
[Polonius] The actors are come hither, my lord.
[Hamlet] Buzz, buzz.
[Polonius] Upon my honor.
[Hamlet] Then came each actor on his ass.
[Polonius] The best actors in the world, either for trage-
dy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical-
historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-
comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or po-
em unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus
too light for the law of writ and the liberty. These are
the only men.
[Hamlet] O Jephthah, Judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst
thou?
[Polonius] What a treasure had he, my lord?
[Hamlet] Why, one fair daughter and no more,
The which he lovèd passing well.
[Polonius] Still on my daughter.
[Hamlet] Am I not i'th' right, old Jephthah?
[Polonius] If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a
daughter that I love passing well.
[Hamlet] Nay, that follows not.
[Polonius] What follows then, my lord?
[Hamlet] Why, as by lot, God wot, and then you know, it came to
pass, as most like it was. The first row of the
pious chanson will show you more, for look where my
abridgments come.
Enter four or five Players.
You are welcome, masters, welcome all.--I am glad to see
thee well. Welcome, good friends.--Oh, my old friend!
Thy face is valiant since I saw thee last. Com'st thou to
beard me in Denmark?--What, my young lady and
mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is nearer heaven than when
I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine. Pray God
your voice, like a piece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked
within the ring.--Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en
to't, like French falconers: fly at anything we see. We'll
have a speech straight. Come, give us a taste of your
quality. Come, a passionate speech.
[Player] What speech, my good lord?
[Hamlet] I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
never acted, or if it was, not above once; for the play, I
remember, pleased not the million, 'twas caviary to the
general. But it was, as I received it, and others whose
judgment in such matters cried in the top of mine, an
excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down
with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
there was no sallets in the lines, to make the matter
savory, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the
author of affectation, but called it an honest method. One
speech in it I chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale
to Dido, and thereabout of it especially where he speaks
of Priam's slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at
this line--let me see, let me see-- The rugged Pyrrhus, like
th'Hyrcanian beast-- It is not so, it begins with Pyrrhus.
The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
When he lay couchèd in the ominous horse,
Hath now this dread and black complexion smeared
With heraldry more dismal; head to foot,
Now is he total gules, horridly tricked
With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
Baked and empasted with the parching streets
That lend a tyrannous and damnèd light
To their vile murders. Roasted in wrath and fire,
And thus o'ersizèd with coagulate gore,
With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Phyrrhus
Old grandsire Priam seeks.
[Polonius] 'Fore God, my Lord, well spoken, with good ac-
cent and good discretion.
[Player] Anon he finds him,
Striking too short at Greeks. His antic sword,
Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
Repugnant to command. Unequal match,
Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide,
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
Th'unnervèd father fall. Then senseless Ilium,
Seeming to feel his blow, with flaming top
Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear; for lo! his sword,
Which was declining on the milky head
Of reverend Priam, seemed i'th' air to stick.
So as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood,
And, like a neutral to his will and matter, Did nothing.
But as we often see against some storm
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
A rousèd vengeance sets him new a-work,
And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
On Mars his armor, forged for proof eterne,
With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
Now falls on Priam.
Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods
In general synod take away her power,
Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven
As low as to the fiends!
[Polonius] This is too long.
[Hamlet] It shall to th' barber's with your beard. Pri-
thee, say on. He's for a jig, or a tale of bawdry, or he
sleeps. Say on. Come to Hecuba..
[Player] But who, oh, who, had seen the inobled queen--
[Hamlet] "The inobled queen!"
[Polonius] That's good. "Inobled queen" is good.
[Player] Run barefoot up and down,
threat'ning the flame
With bisson rheum, a clout upon that head
Where late the diadem stood, and, for a robe,
About her lank and all o'er-teemèd loins
A blanket in th' alarum of fear caught up--
Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steeped
'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounccd!
But if the gods themselves did see her then,
When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
The instant burst of clamor that she made
(Unless things mortal move them not at all)
Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
And passion in the gods.
[Polonius] Look where he has not turned his color, and
has tears in's eyes.--Pray you, no more.
[Hamlet] 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest
soon. Good my lord, will you see the players well
bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used, for they are
the abstract and brief chronicles of the time. After
your death you were better have a bad epitaph than
their ill report while you live.
[Polonius] My lord, I will use them according to their
desert.
[Hamlet] God's bodykins, man, better. Use every man
after his desert and who should scape whipping? Use
them after your own honor and dignity; the less they
deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. Take them
in.
[Polonius] Come, sirs. Exit Polonius.
[Hamlet] Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play tomor-
row. Dost thou hear me, old friend, can you play The
Murder of Gonzago?
[Player] Ay, my lord.
[Hamlet] We'll ha't tomorrow night. You could for a
need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which
I would set down and insert in't, could ye not?
[Player] Ay, my lord.
[Hamlet] Very well. Follow that lord, and look you
mock him not.--My good friends, I'll leave you till night.
You are welcome to Elsinore.
[Rosencrantz] Good my lord. Exeunt.
Manet Hamlet.
[Hamlet] Ay, so, God buy ye. --Now I am alone.
Oh, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
Is it not monstrous that this player here,
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
Could force his soul so to his whole conceit
That from her working all the visage warmed,
Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
With forms to his conceit, and all for nothing?
For Hecuba?
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
That he should weep for her? What would he do
Had he the motive and the cue for passion
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
Make mad the guilty, and appal the free,
Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
The very faculty of eyes and ears. Yet I,
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
And can say nothing; no, not for a king
Upon whose property and most dear life
A damned defeat was made. Am I a coward?
Who calls me villain? Breaks my pate across?
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
Tweaks me by th' nose? Gives me the lie i'th' throat
As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this,
Ha? Why, I should take it; for it cannot be
But I am pigeon-livered, and lack gall
To make oppression bitter, or ere this
I should have fatted all the region kites
With this slave's offal, bloody, a bawdy villain,
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
Oh, vengeance!
Who? What an ass am I! Ay, sure, this is most brave,
That I, the son of the dear murdered,
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
Must like a whore unpack my heart with words,
And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
A scullion? Fie upon't, foh! About, my brain!
I have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play
Have by the very cunning of the scene
Been struck so to the soul that presently
They have proclaimed their malefactions;
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
Play something like the murder of my father
Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench
I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
May be a devil, and the devil hath power
T'assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps,
Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
As he is very potent with such spirits,
Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
More relative than this. The play's the thing
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King. Exit.
Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia,
Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and Lords.
[Claudius] And can you by no drift of circumstance
Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
[Rosencrantz] He does confess he feels himself distracted,
But from what cause, he will by no means speak.
[Guildenstern] Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
When we would bring him on to some confession
Of his true state.
[Gertrude] Did he receive you well?
[Rosencrantz] Most like a gentleman.
[Guildenstern] But with much forcing of his disposition.
[Rosencrantz] Niggard of question, but of our demands
Most free in his reply.
[Gertrude] Did you assay him to any pastime?
[Rosencrantz] Madam, it so fell out that certain players
We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
To hear of it. They are about the court,
And, as I think, they have already order
This night to play before him.
[Polonius] 'Tis most true,
And he beseeched me to entreat your majesties
To hear and see the matter.
[Claudius] With all my heart, and it doth much content me
To hear him so inclined. Good gentlemen,
Give him a further edge, and drive his purpose on
To these delights.
[Rosencrantz] We shall, my lord. Exeunt.
[Claudius] Sweet Gertrude, leave us too,
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
That he, as 'twere by accident, may there
Affront Ophelia. Her father and myself, lawful espials,
Will so bestow our selves that, seeing unseen,
We may of their encounter frankly judge,
And gather by him, as he is behaved,
If't be th'affliction of his love or no
That thus he suffers for.
[Gertrude] I shall obey you;
And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
That your good beauties be the happy cause
Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
Will bring him to his wonted way again,
To both your honors.
[Ophelia] Madam, I wish it may.
[Polonius] Ophelia, walk you here.--Gracious, so please ye,
We will bestow ourselves. Read on this book,
That show of such an exercise may color
Your loneliness. We are oft too blame in this,
'Tis too much proved, that with devotion's visage
And pious action we do sugar o'er
The devil himself.
[Claudius] Oh, 'tis too true!
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
Than is my deed to my most painted word.
Oh, heavy burden!
[Polonius] I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
Exeunt.
Enter Hamlet.
[Hamlet] To be, or not to be, that is the question,
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep--
No more--and by a sleep to say we end
The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to? 'Tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep;
To sleep, perchance to dream. Ay, there's the rub,
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil
Must give us pause. There's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscovered country from whose bourn
No traveler returns, puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sickled o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
And lose the name of action. Soft you now,
The fair Ophelia!--Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins remembered.
[Ophelia] Good my lord,
How does your honor for this many a day?
[Hamlet] I humbly thank you, well, well.
[Ophelia] My lord, I have remembrances of yours
That I have longèd long to redeliver.
I pray you now receive them.
[Hamlet] No, no, I never gave you aught.
[Ophelia] My honored lord, you know right well you did,
And with them words of so sweet breath composed
As made these things more rich. Then, perfume left,
Take these again, for to the noble mind
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind,
There, my lord.
[Hamlet] Ha, ha! Are you honest?
[Ophelia] My lord?
[Hamlet] Are you fair?
[Ophelia] What means your lordship?
[Hamlet] That if you be honest and fair, your honesty
should admit no discourse to your beauty.
[Ophelia] Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce
than your honesty?
[Hamlet] Ay, truly, for the power of beauty will sooner
transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness.
This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it
proof. I did love you once.
[Ophelia] Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
[Hamlet] You should not have believed me, for virtue
cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish
of it. I loved you not.
[Ophelia] I was the more deceived.
[Hamlet] Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou
be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest,
but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were
better my mother had not borne me: I am very proud,
revengeful, ambitious, with more offenses at my beck
than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
them shape, or time to act them in. What should such
fellows as I do crawling between heaven and earth? .
We are arrant knaves all; believe none of us. Go thy
ways to a nunnery. Where's your father?
[Ophelia] At home, my lord.
[Hamlet] Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may
play the fool way but in's own house. Farewell.
[Ophelia] Oh, help him, you sweet heavens!
[Hamlet] If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague
for thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow,
thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery.
Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool,
for wise men know well enough what monsters you
make of them. To a nunnery go, and quickly too. Fare-
well.
[Ophelia] O heavenly powers, restore him!
[Hamlet] I have heard of your paintings too well enough.
God has given you one face, and you make yourself
another. You jig, you amble, and you lisp, and nickname
God's creatures, and make your wantonness your
ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath made me mad.
I say we will have no more marriages. Those that are
married already, but one, shall live; the rest shall keep
as they are. To a nunnery, go. Exit Hamlet.
[Ophelia] Oh, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword,
Th'expectancy and rose of the fair state,
The glass of fashion and the mold of form,
Th'observed of all observers, quite, quite down,
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
That sucked the honey of his music vows,
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune, and harsh,
That unmatched form and feature of blown youth
Blasted with ecstasy. Oh, woe is me
T''have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
Enter King and Polonius.
[Claudius] Love? His affections do not that way tend,
Nor what he spake, though it lacked form a little,
Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
O'er which his melancholy sits on brood,
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
Will be some danger; which to prevent,
I have in quick determination
Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,
For the demand of our neglected tribute.
Haply the seas, and countries different,
With variable objects, shall expel
This something-settled matter in his heart,
Whereon his brains still beating, puts him thus
From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
[Polonius] It shall do well. But yet I do believe
The origin and commencement of this grief
Sprung from neglected love.--How now, Ophelia?
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said,
We heard it all.--My lord, do as you please,
But if you hold it fit, after the play
Let his queen-mother all alone entreat him
To show his grief. Let her be round with him,
And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear
Of all their conference. If she find him not,
To England send him, or confine him where
Your wisdom best shall think.
[Claudius] It shall be so.
Madness in great ones must not unwatched go.
Exeunt.
Enter Hamlet, and two or three of the Players.
[Hamlet] Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced
it to you, trippingly on the tongue; but if you mouth it,
as many of your players do, I had as lief the town crier
had spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with
your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very
torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, whirlwind of must
passion, you acquire and beget a temperance that it
may give it smoothness. Oh, offends me to the soul
to see a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a
passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the
groundlings, who for the most part are capable of
nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise. I could
have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant. It
out-Herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
[Player] I warrant your honor.
[Hamlet] Be not too tame, neither, but let your own
discretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the word, with
the word to the action, this special observance:
that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature. For
anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose
end, both at the first and now, was and is to hold as 'twere
the mirror up to nature, to show virtue her own
feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and
body of the time his form and pressure. Now, this
overdone, or come tardy off, though it makes the
unskillful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve, the
censure of the which one must in your allowance
o'erweigh a whole theater of others. Oh, there be players
that I have seen play, and heard praise, and that
highly, not to speak it profanely, that, neither having
the accent of Christians nor the gate of Christian, pagan,
or Norman, have so strutted and bellowed that I have
thought some of nature's journeymen had made men,
and not made them well, they imitated humanity so
abhominably.
[Player] I hope we have reformed that indifferently with
us, sir.
[Hamlet] Oh, reform it altogether. And let those that
play your clowns speak no more than is set down for
them; for there be of them will themselves laugh,
to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
too, though in the meantime some necessary question
of the play be then to be considered. That's villainous, and
shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses
it. Go make you ready. Exit Players.
Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.
How now, my lord,
Will the King hear this piece of work?
[Polonius] And the Queen too, and that presently.
[Hamlet] Bid the players make haste. Exit Polonius.
Will you two help to hasten them?
[Both] We will, my lord. Exeunt.
Enter Horatio.
[Hamlet] What ho, Horatio!
[Horatio] Here, sweet lord, at your service.
[Hamlet] Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
As e'er my conversation coped withal.
[Horatio] Oh, my dear lord--
[Hamlet] Nay, do not think I flatter,
For what advancement may I hope from thee
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flattered?
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
Where thrift may follow feigning. Dost thou hear?
Since my dear soul was mistress of my choice
And could of men distinguish, her election
Hath sealed thee for herself, for thou hast been
As one in suff'ring all that suffers nothing,
A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
Hath ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--
There is a play to night before the King.
One scene of it comes near the circumstance
Which I have told thee of my father's death.
I prithee, when thou see'st that act afoot,
Even with the very comment of thy soul
Observe mine uncle. If his occulted guilt
Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
It is a damnèd ghost that we have seen,
And my imaginations are as foul
As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note,
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
And after we will both our judgments join
In censure of his seeming.
[Horatio] Well, my lord,
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing
And scape detected, I will pay the theft.
Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with
his Guard carrying torches. Danish
march. Sound a flourish.
[Hamlet] They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
Get you a place.
[Claudius] How fares our cousin Hamlet?
[Hamlet] Excellent, i'faith, of the chameleon's dish; I eat
the air, promise-crammed. You cannot feed capons so.
[Claudius] I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These
words are not mine.
[Hamlet] No, nor mine. Now, my lord, you played once
i'th' university, you say?
[Polonius] That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good
actor
[Hamlet] And what did you enact?
[Polonius] I did enact Julius Caesar. I was killed i'th' Capitol.
Brutus killed me.
[Hamlet] It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a
calf there. Be the players ready?
[Rosencrantz] Ay, my lord, they stay upon your patience.
[Gertrude] Come hither, my good Hamlet, sit by me.
[Hamlet] No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.
[Polonius] Oho, do you mark that?
[Hamlet] Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
[Ophelia] No, my lord.
[Hamlet] I mean, my head upon your lap.
[Ophelia] Ay, my lord.
[Hamlet] Do you think I meant country matters?
[Ophelia] I think nothing, my lord.
[Hamlet] That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
[Ophelia] What is, my lord?
[Hamlet] Nothing.
[Ophelia] You are merry, my lord.
[Hamlet] Who, I?
[Ophelia] Ay, my lord.
[Hamlet] Oh, God, your only jig-maker. What should
a man do but be merry? For look you how cheerful-
ly my mother looks, and my father died within's two
hours.
[Ophelia] Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
[Hamlet] So long? Nay, then, let the devil wear black,
for I'll have suit of sables. Oh, heavens! Die two
months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's hope a
great man's memory may outlive his life half a year.
But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then, or else shall he
suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose
epitaph is, "For oh, for oh, the hobby-horse is forgot."
Hautboys play. The dumb-show enters.
Enter [Players as] a King and Queen very lovingly, the Queen
embracing him. She kneels and makes show of protestation unto He
him. takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck.
Lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing him
asleep, leaves him. Anon come in fellow, takes off his
crown, kisses it, pours poison in the King's ears, and
exits. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and
makes passionate action. The poisoner, with some two or
three mutes, comes in again, seem to lament with her.
The dead body is carried away. The poisoner woos the
Queen with gifts. She seems loath and unwilling awhile,
but in the end accepts love. Exeunt [Players].
[Ophelia] What means this, my lord?
[Hamlet] Marry, this is miching mallico. That means
mischief.
[Ophelia] Belike this show imports the argument of the
play?
[Hamlet] We shall know by these fellows. The players
cannot keep counsel; they'll tell all.
[Ophelia] Will they tell us what this show meant?
[Hamlet] Ay, or any show that you will show him. Be not
you ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it
means.
[Ophelia] You are naught, you are naught. I'll mark the
play.
Enter Prologue.
[Prologue] For us and for our tragedy,
Here stooping to your clemency,
We beg your hearing patiently. [Exit.]
[Hamlet] Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
[Ophelia] 'Tis brief, my lord.
[Hamlet] As woman's love.
Enter King and his Queen.
[Player King] Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbèd ground,
And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen
About the world have times twelve thirties been
Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
[Player Queen] So many journeys may the sun and moon
Make us again count o'er, ere love be done!
But woe is me, you are so sick of late,
So far from cheer and from your former state,
That I distrust you, Yet though I distrust,
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must.
For women's fear and love hold quantity;
In neither aught, or in extremity.
Now what my love is, proof hath made you know,
And as my love is sized, my fear is so.
[Player King] Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
My operant powers my functions leave to do.
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
Honored, beloved; and haply one as kind
For husband shalt thou--
[Player Queen] Oh, confound the rest!
Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
In second husband let me be accurst!
None wed the second but who killed the first.
[Hamlet] Wormwood, wormwood.
[Player Queen] The instances that second marriage move
Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
A second time I kill my husband dead
When second husband kisses me in bed.
[Player King] I do believe you think what now you speak,
But what we do determine, oft we break.
Purpose is but the slave to memory,
Of violent birth, but poor validity,
Which now the fruit unripe sticks on the tree,
But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
Most necessary 'tis that we forget
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
What to ourselves in passion we propose,
The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
The violence of either grief or joy
Their own enactors with themselves destroy.
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
For 'tis a question left us yet to prove
Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
The great man down, you mark his favorite flies;
The poor advanced makes friends of enemies;
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
And who in want a hollow friend doth try
Directly seasons him his enemy.
But orderly to end where I begun,
Our wills and fates do so contrary run
That our devices still are overthrown;
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
So think thou wilt no second husband wed,
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
[Player Queen] Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
Meet what I would have well, and it destroy!
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
If once a widow, ever I be wife!
[Hamlet] If she should break it now!
[Player King] 'Tis deeply sworn.
Sweet, leave me here awhile.
My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
The tedious day with sleep.
[Player Queen] Sleep rock thy brain, sleeps.
And never come mischance between us twain! Exit.
[Hamlet] Madam, how like you this play?
[Gertrude] The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
[Hamlet] Oh, but she'll keep her word.
[Claudius] Have you heard the argument? Is there no
offense in't?
[Hamlet] No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest, no
offense i'th' world.
[Claudius] What do you call the play?
[Hamlet] The Mousetrap. Marry, how? Tropically.
This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna.
Gonzago is the Duke's name, his wife Baptista. You shall see
anon. 'Tis a knavish piece of work, but what o' that ?
Your majesty and we that have free souls, it touches
us not. Let the galled jade winch, our withers are unwrung.
Enter Lucianus.
This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
[Ophelia] You are a good chorus, my lord.
[Hamlet] I could interpret between you and your love,
if I could see the puppets dallying.
[Ophelia] You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
[Hamlet] It would cost you a groaning to take off my
edge.
[Ophelia] Still better and worse.
[Hamlet] So you mistake your husbands.--
Begin, murderer, leave thy damnable faces and
begin. Come, the croaking raven doth bellow for
revenge.
[Lucianus] Thoughts black, hands apt,
drugs fit, and time agreeing,
Considerate season else no creature seeing,
Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice invected,
Thy natural magic and dire property
On wholesome life usurps immediately.
Pours the poison in his ears.
[Hamlet] He poisons him i'th' garden for his estate. His
name's Gonzago. The story is extant, and written in very choice
Italian. You shall see anon how the murderer gets the
love of Gonzago's wife.
[Ophelia] The King rises.
[Hamlet] What, frighted with false fire?
[Gertrude] How fares my lord?
[Polonius] Give o'er the play.
[Claudius] Give me some light. Away!
[All] Lights, lights, lights! Exeunt.
Hamlet and Horatio [remain].
[Hamlet] "Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
The heart ungallèd play,
For some must watch while some must sleep;
So runs the world away."
Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers--if the rest of
my fortunes turn Turk with me--with two provincial
roses on my razed shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry
of players, sir?
[Horatio] Half a share.
[Hamlet] A whole one, I.
For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
This realm dismantled was of Jove himself,
And now reigns here
A very, very pajock.
[Horatio] You might have rhymed.
[Hamlet] O good Horatio, I'll take the Ghost's word for
a thousand pound. Didst perceive?
[Horatio] Very well, my lord.
[Hamlet] Upon the talk of the poisoning?
[Horatio] I did very well note him.
Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
[Hamlet] Oh, ha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders.
For if the King like not the comedy,
Why, then belike he likes it not, perdy.
Come, some music.
[Guildenstern] Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
[Hamlet] Sir a whole history.
[Guildenstern] The King, sir--
[Hamlet] Ay, sir, what of him?
[Guildenstern] Is in his retirement, marvelous distempered.
[Hamlet] With drink, sir?
[Guildenstern] No, my lord, rather with choler.
[Hamlet] Your wisdom should show itself more
richer to signify this to his doctor, for, for me to put him
to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far
more choler.
[Guildenstern] Good my lord, put your discourse into some
frame, and stare not so wildly from my affair.
[Hamlet] I am tame sir. Pronounce.
[Guildenstern] The Queen your mother, in most great
affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you.
[Hamlet] You are welcome.
[Guildenstern] Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of
the right breed. If it shall please you to make me a
wholesome answer, I will do your mother's commandment.
If not, your pardon and my return shall be the end of
my business.
[Hamlet] Sir, I cannot.
[Rosencrantz] What, my lord?
[Hamlet] Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's
diseased. But, sir, such answer as I can make, you shall
command, or rather, you say, my mother. Therefore no more,
but to the matter. My mother, you say.
[Rosencrantz] Then thus she says: your behavior hath struck
her into amazement and admiration.
[Hamlet] Oh, wonderful son, that can so astonish a
mother! But is there no sequel at the heels of this mo-
ther's admiration?
[Rosencrantz] She desires to speak with you in her closet
ere you go to bed.
[Hamlet] We shall obey, were she ten times our mother.
Have you any further trade with us?
[Rosencrantz] My lord, you once did love me.
[Hamlet] So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.
[Rosencrantz] Good my lord, what is your cause of
distemper? You do surely bar the door of your own
liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend.
[Hamlet] Sir, I lack advancement.
[Rosencrantz] How can that be, when you have the voice of
the King himself for your succession in Denmark?
[Hamlet] Ay, sir, but "While the grass grows"-- the proverb is
something musty.
Enter one with a recorder.
Oh, the recorder. Let me see. To withdraw with you, why
do you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you
would drive me into a toil?
[Guildenstern] Oh, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love
is too unmannerly.
[Hamlet] I do not well understand that. Will you play
upon this pipe?
[Guildenstern] My lord, I cannot.
[Hamlet] I pray you.
[Guildenstern] Believe me, I cannot.
[Hamlet] I do beseech you.
[Guildenstern] I know no touch of it, my lord.
[Hamlet] 'Tis as easy as lying. Govern these ventages
with your finger and thumb, give it breath with your
mouth, and it will discourse most excellent music.
Look you, these are the stops.
[Guildenstern] But these cannot I command to any utterance
of harmony. I have not the skill.
[Hamlet] Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing
you make of me! You would play upon me, you would
seem to know my stops, you would pluck out the heart
of my mystery, you would sound me from my lowest
note to the top of my compass, and there is much
music, excellent voice in this little organ, yet cannot
you make it. Why, do you think that I am easier to be
played on than a pipe? Call me what instrument you will,
though you fret me, you cannot play upon me. God
bless you, sir.
Enter Polonius.
[Polonius] My lord, the queen would speak with you,
and presently.
[Hamlet] Do you see yonder cloud? That's almost in shape
like a camel.
[Polonius] By th' mass, and it's like a camel indeed.
[Hamlet] Methinks it is like a weasel.
[Polonius] It is backed like a weasel.
[Hamlet] Or like a whale?
[Polonius] Very like a whale.
[Hamlet] Then I will come to my mother by and by.
They fool me to the top of my bent.
I will come by and by.
[Polonius] I will say so. Exit.
"By and by" is easily said. Leave me, friends.
'Tis now the very witching time of night,
When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breaks out
Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood,
And do such bitter business as the bitter day
Would quake to look on. Soft, now to my mother.
O heart, loose not thy nature! Let not ever
The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites:
How in my words somever she be shent,
To give them seals, never my soul consent! Exit.
Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.
[Claudius] I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you.
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
And he to England shall along with you.
The terms of our estate may not endure
Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow
Out of his lunacies.
[Guildenstern] We will ourselves provide.
Most holy and religious fear it is
To keep those many many bodies safe
That live and feed upon your majesty.
[Rosencrantz] The single
and peculiar life is bound
With all the strength and armor of the mind
To keep itself from noyance, but much more
That spirit upon whose spirit depends and rests
The lives of many. The cease of majesty
Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel
Fixed on the summit of the highest mount,
To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
Are mortised and adjoined, which, when it falls,
Each small annexment, petty consequence,
Attends the boist'rous rain. Never alone
Did the king sigh, but a general groan.
[Claudius] Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage,
For we will fetters put upon this fear
Which now goes too free-footed.
[Both] We will haste us. Exeunt gentlemen.
Enter Polonius.
[Polonius] My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
Behind the arras I'll convey myself
To hear the process, I'll warrant she'll tax him home,
And, as you said--and wisely was it said--
'Tis meet that some more audience then a mother,
Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
The speech of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
And tell you what I know.
[Claudius] Thanks, dear my lord.
Oh, my offense is rank! It smells to heaven.
It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
A brother's murder. Pray can I not,
Though inclination be as sharp as will;
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
And like a man to double business bound
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
And both neglect. What if this cursèd hand
Were thicker then itself with brother's blood,
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
But to confront the visage of offense?
And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
To be forestallèd ere we come to fall,
Or pardoned being down? Then I'll look up;
My fault is past. But, oh, what form of prayer
Can serve my turn? "Forgive me my foul murder"?
That cannot be, since I am still possessed
Of those effects for which I did the murder:
My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
May one be pardoned and retain th'offense?
In the corrupted currents of this world,
Offense's gilded hand may shove by justice,
And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
Buys out the law. But 'tis not so above:
There is no shuffling, there the action lies
In his true nature, and we ourselves compelled,
Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
Try what repentance can. What can it not?
Yet what can it, when one cannot repent?
O wretched state, O bosom black as death,
O limèd soul, that, struggling to be free,
Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay.
Bow, stubborn knees, and heart with strings of steel,
Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!
All may be well.
Enter Hamlet.
[Hamlet] Now might I do it pat, now he is praying,
And now I'll do 't, and so he goes to heaven,
And so am I revenged. That would be scanned,
A villain kills my father, and for that,
I, his sole son, do this same villain send
To heaven. Oh, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
He took my father grossly, full of bread,
With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May,
And how his audit stands, who knows, save heaven?
But in our circumstance and course of thought
'Tis heavy with him. And am I then revenged
To take him in the purging of his soul,
When he is fit and seasoned for his passage? No.
Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,
Or in th'incestuous pleasure of his bed,
At game, swearing, or about some act
That has no relish of salvation in't,
Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
And that his soul may be as damned and black
As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days. Exit.
[Claudius] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
Words without thoughts never to heaven go. Exit.
Enter Queen and Polonius.
[Polonius] He will come straight.
Look you lay home to him.
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
And that your grace hath screened and stood between
Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
Pray you, be round with him.
[Hamlet] within Mother, mother, mother!
[Gertrude] I'll warrant you, fear me not.
Withdraw, I hear him coming.
Enter Hamlet.
[Hamlet] Now mother, what's the matter?
[Gertrude] Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
[Hamlet] Mother, you have my father much offended.
[Gertrude] Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
[Hamlet] Go, go, you question with an idle tongue.
[Gertrude] Why, how now, Hamlet?
[Hamlet] What's the matter now?
[Gertrude] Have you forgot me?
[Hamlet] No, by the rood, not so.
You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife,
And, would it were not so, you are my mother.
[Gertrude] Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.
[Hamlet] Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not
budge.
You go not till I set you up a glass
Where you may see the inmost part of you.
[Gertrude] What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me?
Help, help, ho!
[Polonius] What ho! Help, help, help!
[Hamlet] How now, a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
[Polonius] Oh, I am slain! Kills Polonius.
[Gertrude] Oh, me, what hast thou done?
[Hamlet] Nay I know not. Is it the King?
[Gertrude] Oh, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
[Hamlet] A bloody deed--almost as bad, good mother,
As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
[Gertrude] As kill a king?
[Hamlet] Ay, lady, 'twas my word.
Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
Leave wringing of your hands. Peace, sit you down,
And let me wring your heart, for so I shall,
If it be made of penetrable stuff,
If damnèd custom have not brazed it so
That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
[Gertrude] What have I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
In noise so rude against me?
[Hamlet] Such an act
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
From the fair forehead of an innocent love
And makes a blister there, makes marriage vows
As false as dicers' oaths--oh, such a deed
As from the body of contraction plucks
The very soul, and sweet religion makes
A rhapsody of words. Heaven's face doth glow,
Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
With heated visage as against the doom,
Is thought-sick at the act.
[Gertrude] Ay me, what act, That roars so loud and
thunders in the index?
[Hamlet] Look here upon this picture, and on this,
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
See what a grace was seated on his brow:
Hyperion's curls, the front of Jove himself,
An eye like Mars to threaten or command,
A station like the herald Mercury
New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill,
A combination and a form indeed
Where every god did seem to set his seal
To give the world assurance of a man.
This was your husband. Look you now what follows:
Here is your husband, like a mildewed ear,
Blasting his wholesome breath. Have you eyes?
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed
And batten on this moor? Have you eyes?
You cannot call it love, for at your age
The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
And waits upon the judgment, and what judgment
Would step from this to this? What devil was't
That thus hath cozened you at hoodman-blind?
O shame, where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
When the compulsive ardor gives the charge,
Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
As reason pardons will.
[Gertrude] Oh, Hamlet speak no more!
Thou turn'st mine very eyes into my soul,
And there I see such black and grainèd spots
As will leave there their tinct.
[Hamlet] Nay, but to live
In the rank sweat of an enseamèd bed
Stewed in corruption, honeying and making love
Over the nasty sty!
[Gertrude] Oh, speak to me no more!
These words like daggers enter in my ears.
No more, sweet Hamlet.
[Hamlet] A murderer and a villain,
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
Of your precedent lord, a vice of kings,
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
And put it in his pocket--
[Gertrude] No more!
Enter Ghost.
[Hamlet] A king of shreds and patches--
Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
You heavenly guards! What would you, gracious figure?
[Gertrude] Alas, he's mad!
[Hamlet] Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by
Th'important acting of your dread command? Oh, say!
[Ghost] Doe not forget. This visitation
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
Oh, step between her and her fighting soul!
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
Speak to her, Hamlet.
[Hamlet] How is it with you, lady?
[Gertrude] Alas, how is't with you,
That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
And with th'incorporal air do hold discourse?
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep,
And, as the sleeping soldiers in th'alarm,
Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
[Hamlet] On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
His form and cause conjoined, preaching to stones,
Would make them capable. Do not look upon me,
Lest with this piteous action you convert
My stern effects. Then what I have to do
Will want true color, tears perchance for blood.
[Gertrude] To whom do you speak this?
[Hamlet] Do you see nothing there?
[Gertrude] Nothing at all, yet all that is I see.
[Hamlet] Nor did you nothing hear?
[Gertrude] No, nothing but ourselves.
[Hamlet] Why, look you there, look how it steals away!
My father in his habit as he lived.
Look where he goes, even now out at the portal! Exit [Ghost].
[Gertrude] This is the very coinage of your brain.
This bodiless creation ecstasy is very cunning in.
[Hamlet] Ecstasy?
My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time,
And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
That I have uttered. Bring me to the test,
And I the matter will reword, which madness
Would gambol from, Mother, for love of grace,
Lay not a flattering unction to your soul
That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven,
Repent what's past, avoid what is to come,
And do not spread the compost o'er the weeds
To make them rank. Forgive me this my virtue,
For in the fatness of these pursy times
Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
[Gertrude] Oh, Hamlet,
thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
[Hamlet] Oh, throw away the worser part of it,
And live the purer with the other half.
Good night. But go not to mine uncle's bed;
Assume a virtue if you have it not. Refrain tonight,
And that shall lend a kind of easiness
To the next abstinence. Once more good night,
And when you are desirous to be blest,
I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,
I do repent; but heaven hath pleased it so
To punish me with this, and this with me,
That I must be their scourge and minister.
I will bestow him and will answer well
The death I gave him. So, again, good night.
I must be cruel only to be kind.
This bad begins, and worse remains behind.
[Gertrude] What shall I do?
[Hamlet] Not this by no means that I bid you do:
Let the blunt King tempt you again to bed,
Pinch wanton on your cheek, call you his mouse,
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
Or paddling in your neck with his damned fingers,
Make you to ravel all this matter out
That I essentially am not in madness,
But mad in craft, 'Twere good you let him know,
For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?
No, in dispite of sense and secrecy,
Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
To try conclusions, in the basket creep
And break your own neck down.
[Gertrude] Be thou assured, if words be made of breath
And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
What thou hast said to me.
[Hamlet] I must to England, You know that?
[Gertrude] Alack, I had forgot. 'Tis so concluded on. [Hamlet]
This man shall set me packing.
I'll lug the guts into the neighbor room.
Mother, good night. Indeed, this counselor
Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
Who was in life a foolish prating knave.--
Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.--
Good night, mother.
Exit Hamlet, tugging in Polonius.
Enter King.
[Claudius] There's matter in these sighs,
these profound heaves.
You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
Where is your son? [Gertrude]
[Gertude] Ah, my good lord, what have I seen tonight!
[Claudius] What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
[Gertrude] Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit,
Behind the arras hearing something stir,
He whips his rapier out, and cries, "A rat, a rat!"
And in his brainish apprehension kills
The unseen good old man.
[Claudius] Oh, heavy deed!
It had been so with us had we been there.
His liberty is full of threats to all,
To you yourself, to us, to everyone.
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answered?
It will be laid to us, whose providence
Should have kept short, restrained, and out of haunt
This mad young man. But so much was our love,
We would not understand what was most fit,
But like the owner of a foul disease,
To keep it from divulging, lets it feed
Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
[Gertrude] To draw apart the body he hath killed,
O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
Among a mineral of metals base,
Shows itself pure: he weeps for what is done.
[Claudius] Oh, Gertrude, come away!
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
But we will ship him hence, and this vile deed
We must with all our majesty and skill
Both countenance, and excuse. Enter Rosecrantz and Guildenstern.
Ho, Guildenstern!
Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
And from his mother's closets hath he dragged him.
Go seek him out, speak fair, and bring the body
Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this. Exit Gentlemen.
Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends
And let them know both what we mean to do
And what's untimely done. Oh, come away!
My soul is full of discord and dismay. Exeunt.
Enter Hamlet.
[Hamlet] Safely stowed.
[Gentlemen] Within Hamlet, Lord Hamlet!
[Hamlet] What noise? Who calls on Hamlet?
Oh, here they come. Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
[Rosencrantz]What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
[Hamlet] Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
[Rosencrantz] Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
and bear it to the chapel.
[Hamlet] Do not believe it.
[Rosencrantz] Believe what?
[Hamlet] That I can keep your counsel and not mine
own. Besides, to be demanded of a sponge, what
replication should be made by the son of a king?
[Rosencrantz] Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
[Hamlet] Ay, sir, that soaks up the King's countenance, his
rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the King
best service in the end: he keeps them like an apple in
the corner of his jaw, first mouthed to be last swallowed.
When he needs what you have gleaned, it is but squee-
zing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry again.
[Rosencrantz] I understand you not, my lord.
[Hamlet] I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a
foolish ear.
[Rosencrantz] My lord, you must tell us where the body is
and go with us to the King.
[Hamlet] The body is with the King, but the King is not
with the body. The King is a thing--
[Guildenstern] A thing, my lord?
[Hamlet] Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all
after! Exeunt.
Enter King.
[Claudius] I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
Yet must not we put the strong law on him;
He's loved of the distracted multitude,
Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes,
And where 'tis so, th'offender's scourge is weighed,
But ne'er the offense. To bear all smooth and even,
This sudden sending him away must seem
Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
By desperate appliance are relieved,
Or not at all. Enter Rosencrantz.
How now, what hath befall'n?
[Rosencrantz] Where the dead body is bestowed, my lord,
We cannot get from him.
[Claudius] But where is he?
[Rosencrantz] Without, my lord, guarded, to know your
pleasure.
[Claudius] Bring him before us.
[Rosencrantz] [Calling] Ho! Bring in my lord.
Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern.
[Claudius] Now Hamlet, where's Polonius?
[Hamlet] At supper.
[Claudius] At supper? Where?
[Hamlet] Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A
certain convocation of worms are e'en at him. Your worm
is your only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else
to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king
and your lean beggar is but variable service to dishes,
but to one table, that's the end.
[Claudius] What dost thou mean by this?
[Hamlet] Nothing but to show you how a king may go
a progress through the guts of a beggar.
[Claudius] Where is Polonius?
[Hamlet] In heaven. Send thither to see. If your
messenger find him not there, seek him i'th' other place
yourself. But if indeed you find him not this month, you
shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby.
[Claudius] Go seek him there.
[Hamlet] He will stay till ye come.
[Claudius] Hamlet, this deed of thine, for thine especial safety--
Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
For that which thou hast done--must send thee hence
With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
Th'associates tend, and everything is bent
For England.
[Hamlet] For England!
[Claudius] Ay, Hamlet.
[Hamlet] Good.
[Claudius] So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
[Hamlet] I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for
England! Farewell, dear mother.
[Claudius] Thy loving father, Hamlet.
[Hamlet] My mother. Father and mother is man and
wife, man and wife is one flesh, and so, my mother. Come,
for England! Exit.
[Claudius] Follow him at foot.
Tempt him with speed aboard.
Delay it not. I'll have him hence tonight.
Away! For everything is sealed and done
That else leans on th'affair. Pray you, make haste.
And England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,
As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
Pays homage to us, thou mayst not coldly set
Our sovereign process, which imports at full
By letters conjuring to that effect
The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England,
For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun. Exit.
Enter Fortinbras with an army.
[Fortinbras] Go, captain, from me greet the Danish King.
Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
Claims the conveyance of a promised march
Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
If that his majesty would aught with us,
We shall express our duty in his eye;
And let him know so.
[Captain] I will do't, my lord.
[Fortinbras] Go softly on. Exit.
Enter Queen and Horatio.
[Gertrude] I will not speak with her.
[Horatio] She is importunate, Indeed, distract. Her mood
will needs be pitied.
[Gertrude] What would she have?
[Horatio] She speaks much of her father, says she hears
There's tricks i'th' world, and hems, and beats her heart,
Spurns enviously at straws, speaks things in doubt
That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
Yet the unshapèd use of it doth move
The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts,
Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
Indeed would make one think there would be thought,
Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
[Gertrude] 'Twere good she were spoken with,
For she may strew dangerous conjectures
In ill-breeding minds. Let her come in.
To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss.
So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
Enter Ophelia, distracted.
[Ophelia] Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
[Gertrude] How now, Ophelia?
[Ophelia] How should I your true love know from another one?
By his cockle hat and staff, and his sandal shoon.
[Gertrude] Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
[Ophelia] Say you? Nay, pray you, mark.
He is dead and gone, lady, he is dead and gone.
At his head a grass-green turf, at his heels a stone.
Enter King.
[Gertrude] Nay, but Ophelia--
[Ophelia] Pray you, mark.
White his shroud as the mountain snow--
[Gertrude] Alas, look here, my lord.
[Ophelia] Larded with sweet flowers,
Which bewept to the ground did not go
With true-love showers.
[Claudius] How do ye, pretty lady?
[Ophelia] Well God dild you. They say the owl was
a baker's daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but
know not what we may be. God be at your table!
[Claudius] Conceit upon her father.
[Ophelia] Pray you, let's have no words of this, but when
they ask you what it means, say you this:
Tomorrow is Saint Valentine's day, All in the morning betime,
And I a maid at your window To be your Valentine.
Then up he rose, and donned his clothes, and dupped the chamber door,
Let in the maid, that out a maid never departed more.
[Claudius] Pretty Ophelia--
[Ophelia] Indeed, la! Without an oath I'll make an end on't.
By Gis and by Saint Charity,
Alack, and fie for shame!
Young men will do't if they come to't;
By Cock, they are too blame.
Quoth she, "Before you tumbled me,
you promised me to wed."
"So would I ha 'done, by yonder sun,
An thou hadst not come to my bed."
[Claudius] How long hath she been thus?
[Ophelia] I hope all will be well. We must be patient.
But I cannot choose but weep to think they should
lay him i'th' cold ground. My brother shall know of it.
And so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my
coach! Good night, ladies, good night. sweet ladies,
good night, good night. Exit.
[Claudius] Follow her close.
Give her good watch, I pray you.
Oh, this is the poison of deep grief! It springs
All from her father's death. Oh, Gertrude, Gertrude,
When sorrows come, they come not single spies
But in battalias. First, her father slain;
Next, your son gone, and he most violent author
Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
Thick and unwholesome in thoughts and whispers
For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia
Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts;
Last, and as much containing as all these,
Her brother is in secret come from France,
Keeps on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
Wherein necessity, of matter beggared,
Will nothing stick our persons to arraign
In ear and ear. Oh, my dear Gertrude, this,
Like to a murdering piece, in many places
Gives me superfluous death. A noise within.
Enter a Messenger.
[Gertrude] Alack, what noise is this?
[Claudius] Attend! Where are my Switzers,?
Let them guard the door. What is the matter?
[Messenger] Save yourself, my lord!
The ocean, overpeering of his list,
Eats not the flats with more impiteous haste
Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord,
And, as the world were now but to begin,
Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
The ratifiers and props of every word,
They cry, "Choose we! Laertes shall be king!"
Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds:
"Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!"
[Gertrude] How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
Oh, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
Noise within. Enter Laertes.
[Claudius] The doors are broke.
[Laertes] Where is this king?--Sirs, stand you all without.
[All] No let's come in.
[Laertes] I pray you, give me leave.
[All] We will, we will.
[Laertes] I thank you. Keep the door.
O thou vile king, give me my father!
[Gertrude] Calmly, good Laertes.
[Laertes] That drop of blood that's calm
proclaims me bastard,
Cries "Cuckold!" to my father, brands the harlot
Even here between the chaste unsmirchèd brow
Of my true mother.
[Claudius] What is the cause, Laertes,
That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?--
Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.
There's such divinity doth hedge a king
That treason can but peep to what it would,
Acts little of his will.--Tell me, Laertes,
Why thou art thus incensed?--Let him go, Gertrude.--
Speak, man.
[Laertes] Where's my father?
[Claudius] Dead.
[Gertrude] But not by him.
[Claudius] Let him demand his fill.
[Laertes] How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with.
To hell, allegiance! Vows, to the blackest devil!
Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
That both the worlds I give to negligence,
Let come what comes, only I'll be revenged
Most throughly for my father.
[Claudius] Who shall stay you?
[Laertes] My will, not all the world.
And for my means, I'll husband them so well
They shall go far with little.
[Claudius] Good Laertes,
if you desire to know the certainty
Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge
That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
Winner and loser?
[Laertes] None but his enemies,
[Claudius] Will you know them, then?
[Laertes] To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms,
And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
Repast them with my blood.
[Claudius] Why, now you speak
Like a good child and a true gentleman.
That I am guiltless of your father's death,
And am most sensible in grief for it,
It shall as level to your judgment pierce
As day does to your eye.
A noise within. Let her come in.
Enter Ophelia
[Laertes] How now, what noise is that?
O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
Till our scale turns the beam. O rose of May,
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
O heavens, is't possible a young maid's wits
Should be as mortal as a poor man's life?
Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine
It sends some precious instance of itself
After the thing it loves.
[Ophelia] They bore him bare-faced on the bier,
Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny,
And in his grave rains many a tear.
Fare you well, my dove.
[Laertes] Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade
revenge, It could not move thus.
[Ophelia] You must sing "down, a-down," an you call
him "a-down-a." Oh, how the wheel becomes it! It is
the false steward that stole his master's daughter.
[Laertes] This nothing's more than matter.
[Ophelia] There's rosemary; that's for remembrance.
Pray, love, remember. And there is pansies; that's for
thoughts.
[Laertes] A document in madness, thoughts and
remembrance fitted.
[Ophelia] There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's
rue for you, and here's some for me. We may call it
herb-grace o'Sundays. Oh, you must wear your rue
with a difference. There's a daisy. I would give you
some violets, but they withered all when my father di-
ed. They say he made a good end.
For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.
[Laertes] Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself
She turns to favor and to prettiness.
[Ophelia] And will he not come again?
And will he not come again?
No, no, he is dead, go to thy deathbed,
He never will come again.
His beard as white as snow,
All flaxen was his poll.
He is gone, he is gone, and we cast away moan.
Gramercy on his soul!
and of all Christians' souls, I pray God.
God buy you! Exeunt Ophelia.
[Laertes] Do you see this, you gods?
[Claudius] Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
If by direct or by collateral hand
They find us touched, we will our kingdom give,
Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours
To you in satisfaction; but if not,
Be you content to lend your patience to us,
And we shall jointly labor with your soul
To give it due content.
[Laertes] Let this be so.
His means of death, his obscure burial--
No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
No noble rite, nor formal ostentation--
Cry to be heard as 'twere from heaven to earth,
That I must call in question.
[Claudius] So you shall,
And where th'offense is, let the great ax fall.
I pray you go with me. Exeunt.
Enter Horatio with an Attendant.
[Horatio] What are they that would speak with me?
[Servingman] Sailors, sir. They say they have letters for you.
[Horatio] Let them come in.
I do not know from what part of the world
I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
Enter Sailor.
[Sailor] God bless you, sir.
[Horatio] Let him bless thee too.
[Sailor] He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter came
for you, sir. It comes from th'ambassadors that was
bound for England, if your name be Horatio, as I am let
to know it is.
Reads the letter.
Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked this, give these
fellows some means to the King; they have letters
for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of very
warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
slow of sail, we put on a compelled valor. In the grapple, I
boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship, so
I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like to
thieves of mercy, but they knew what they did. I am do
a good turn for them. Let the King have the letters I have
sent, and repair thou to me with as much haste as thou wouldest
fly death. I have words to speak in your ear will make thee are
dumb, yet they much too light for the bore of the matter.
These good fellows will bring thee where I am. Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern hold their course for England. Of them
I have much to tell thee. Farewell.
He that thou knowest thine,
Hamlet.
[Horatio] Come, I will give you way for these your letters,
And do't the speedier that you may direct me
To him from whom you brought them. Exit.
Enter King and Laertes.
[Claudius] Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
And you must put me in your heart for friend,
Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
That he which hath your noble father slain
Pursued my life.
[Laertes] It well appears. But tell me
Why you proceed not against these feats
So criminal and so capital in nature,
As by your safety, greatness, wisdom, all things else,
You mainly were stirred up.
[Claudius] Oh for two special reasons,
Which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewed,
But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
Lives almost by his looks, and for myself--
My virtue or my plague, be it either which--
She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
I could not but by her. The other motive
Why to a public count I might not go
Is the great love the general gender bear him,
Who. dipping all his faults in their affection,
Work like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
Convert his gyves to graces, so that my arrows.
Too slightly timbered for so loud a wind,
Would have reverted to my bow again,
But not where I had armed them.
[Laertes] And so have I a noble father lost,
A sister driven into desperate terms,
Who has, if praises may go back again,
Stood challenger on mount of all the age
For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
[Claudius] Break not your sleeps for that.
You must not think
That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
That we can let our beard be shook with danger
And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
I loved your father, and we love ourself,
And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--
Enter a Messenger.
[Claudius] How now? What news?
[Messenger] Letters, my lord, from Hamlet. This to your
majesty, this to the Queen.
[Claudius] From Hamlet? Who brought them?
[Messenger] Sailors, my lord, they say. I saw them not.
They were given me by Claudio. He received them.
[Claudius] Laertes, you shall hear them.
Leave us. Exit Messenger.
High and mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your
kingdom. Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly
eyes, when I shall (first asking your pardon thereunto)
recount th'occasions of my sudden and more strange return.
Hamlet.
[Claudius] What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
Or is it some abuse? Or no such thing?
[Laertes] Know you the hand?
[Claudius] 'Tis Hamlet's character. "Naked!" And in a
postscript here he says "alone." Can you advise me?
[Laertes] I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come.
It warms the very sickness in my heart
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth
"Thus didest thou."
[Claudius] If it be so, Laertes-- As how should it be so,
how otherwise?-- Will you be ruled by me?
[Laertes] If so you'll not o'errule me to a peace.
[Claudius] To thine own peace. If he be now returned
As checking at his voyage, and that he means
No more to undertake it, I will work him
To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,
But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
And call it accident. Some two months hence
Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
I've seen myself, and served against, the French,
And they ran well on horseback, but this gallant
Had witchcraft in't; he grew into his seat,
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
As had he been incorpsed and demi-natured
With the brave beast. So far he topped my thought
That I in forgery of shapes and tricks
Come short of what he did.
[Laertes] A Norman was't?
[Claudius] A Norman.
[Laertes] Upon my life, Lamound.
[Claudius] The very same.
[Laertes] I know him well. He is the brooch indeed
And gem of all our nation.
[Claudius] He made confession of you,
And gave you such a masterly report
For art and exercise in your defense,
And for your rapier most especially,
That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
If one could match you, sir. This report of his
Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
That he could nothing do but wish and beg
Your sudden coming o'er to play with him.
Now, out of this--
[Laertes] What out of this, my lord?
[Claudius] Laertes, was your father dear to you?
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
A face without a heart?
[Laertes] Why ask you this?
[Claudius] Not that I think you did not love your father,
But that I know love is begun by time,
And that I see, in passages of proof,
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
To show yourself your father's son indeed,
More than in words?
[Laertes] To cut his throat i'th' church.
[Claudius] No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize.
Revenge should have no bounds. But good Laertes,
Will you do this: keep close within your chamber.
Hamlet returned shall know you are come home.
We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
And set a double varnish on the fame
The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together.
And wager o'er your heads. He being remiss,
Most generous, and free from all contriving,
Will not peruse the foils, so that with ease,
Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
A sword unbated, and in a pace of practice
Requite him for your father.
[Laertes] I will do't,
And for purpose I'll anoint my sword.
I bought an unction of a mountebank
So mortal I but dipped a knife in it,
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
Collected from all simples that have virtue
Under the moon, can save the thing from death
That is but scratched withal. I'll touch my point
With this contagion, that if I gall him slightly,
It may be death.
[Claudius] Lets further think of this.
Weigh what convenience both of time and means
May fit us to our shape. If this should fail,
And that our drift look through our bad performance,
'Twere better not assayed. Therefore this project
Should have a back or second, that might hold
If this should blast in proof. Soft, let me see.
We'll make a solemn wager on your comings--
I ha't! When in your motion you are hot and dry--
As make your bouts more violent to that end--
And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him
A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,
If he by chance escape your venomed stuck,
Our purpose may hold there.--How, sweet Queen?
Enter Queen.
[Gertrude] One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
So fast they'll follow. Your sister's drowned, Laertes.
[Laertes] Drowned! Oh, where?
[Gertrude] There is a willow grows aslant a brook
That shows his hoary leaves in the glassy stream.
There with fantastic garlands did she come,
Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,
When down her weedy trophies and herself
Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,
And mermaid-like awhile they bore her up,
Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes,
As one incapable of her own distress,
Or like a creature native and endued
Unto that element. But long it could not be
Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
Pulled the poor wretch from her melodious lay
To muddy death.
[Laertes] Alas, then, she is drowned?
[Gertrude] Drowned, drowned.
[Laertes] Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
And therefore I forbid my tears. But yet
It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
I have a speech of fire that fain would blaze,
But that this folly douts it. Exit.
[Claudius] Let's follow, Gertrude.
How much I had to do to calm his rage!
Now fear I this will give it start again;
Therefore let's follow. Exeunt.
Enter two Clowns.
[Clown] Is she to be buried in Christian burial, that
willfully seeks her own salvation?
[Other] I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave
straight. The crowner hath sat on her, and finds it Chri-
stian burial.
[Clown] How can that be, unless she drowned herself in
her own defense?
[Other] Why, 'tis found so.
[Clown] It must be se offendendo , it cannot be else. For
here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it
argues an act, and an act hath three branches: it is an
act, to do, and to perform. Argal, she drowned herself
wittingly.
[Other] Nay, but hear you, goodman delver.
[Clown] Give me leave. Here lies the water; good.
Here stands the man; good. If the man go to this
water and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he goes;
mark you that? But if the water come to him and drown
him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is not
guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
[Other] But is this law?
[Clown] Ay, marry, is't, crowner's quest law.
[Other] Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not
been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried
out of Christian burial.
[Clown] Why, there thou say'st, and the more pity that
great folk should have countenance in this world to
drown or hang themselves more then their even-Christ-
en. Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentlemen
but gardeners, ditchers, and gravemakers. They hold up
Adam's profession.
[Other] Was he a gentleman?
[Clown] He was the first that ever bore arms.
[Other] Why, he had none.
[Clown] Why, art a heathen? How dost thou under-
stand the Scripture? The Scripture says Adam digged.
Could he did without arms? I'll put another
question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the purpose,
confess thyself--
[Other] Go to.
[Clown] What is he that builds stronger than either the
mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?
[Other] The gallows-maker, for that outlives a
thousand tenants.
[Clown] I like thy wit well, in good faith, the gallows
does well. But how does it well? It does well to those
that do ill. Now, thou dost ill to say the gallows is
built stronger than the church. Argal, the gallows
may do well to thee. To't again, come.
[Other] "Who builds stronger than a mason, a
shipwright, or a carpenter?"
[Clown] Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
[Other] Marry, now I can tell.
[Clown] To't.
[Other] Mass, I cannot tell.
Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.
[Clown] Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your
dull ass will not mend his pace with beating; and when
you are asked this question next, say "a grave-maker." The
houses he makes lasts till doomsday. Go, get thee
to Youghan, fetch me a stoop of liquor.
Sings.
In youth when I did love, did love,
Methought it was very sweet
To contract--oh--the time for--a--my behove,
Oh, methought there--a-- was nothing--a-- meet.
[Hamlet] Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that
he sings at gravemaking?
[Horatio] Custom hath made it in him a property of
easiness.
[Hamlet] 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath
the daintier sense.
Clown sings.
[Clown] But age with his stealing steps
Hath clawed me in his clutch,
And hath shipped me into the land,
As if I had never been such.
[Hamlet] That skull had a tongue in it and could sing
once. How the knave jowls it to th' ground, as if it
were Cain's jawbone, that did the first murder! It
might be the pate of a politician, which this ass now
o'erreaches, one that would circumvent God, might it not?
[Horatio] It might, my lord.
[Hamlet] Or of a courtier, which could say, "Good
morrow, sweet lord, how dost thou, sweet lord?" This
might be my Lord Such-a-one, that praised my Lord
Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it, might it not?
[Horatio] Ay, my lord.
[Hamlet] Why, e'en so. And now my Lady Worm's,
chapless, and knocked about the mazard with a sexton's
spade. Here's fine revolution, if we had the trick to
see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding but
to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
on't.
[Clown] Song.
A pickax and a spade, a spade,
For and a shrouding sheet;
Oh, a pit of clay for to be made
For such a guest is meet.
[Hamlet] There's another. Why may not that be the
skull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddits now? His
quillets? His cases? His tenures, and his tricks? Why
does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about
the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of
his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's
time a great buyer of land, with his statutes, his
recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries.
Is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of his
recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? Will his
vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases, and
double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of
indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will
hardly lie in this box, and must th'inheritor himself
have no more? Ha?
[Horatio] Not a jot more, my lord.
[Hamlet] Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
[Horatio] Ay, my lord, and of calves' skins too.
[Hamlet] They are sheep and calves which seek out
assurance in that. I will speak to this fellow.--Whose grave's
this, sir?
[Clown] Mine, sir.
Oh, a pit of clay for to be made
For such a guest is meet.
[Hamlet] I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
[Clown] You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
For my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.
[Hamlet] Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine.
'Tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou
liest.
[Clown] 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me
to you.
[Hamlet] What man dost thou dig it for?
[Clown] For no man, sir.
[Hamlet] What woman, then?
[Clown] For none, neither.
[Hamlet] Who is to be buried in't?
[Clown] One that was a woman, sir, but, rest her soul,
she's dead.
[Hamlet] How absolute the knave is! We must speak
by the card, or equivocation will undo us. By the
Lord, Horatio, these three years I have taken note of it,
the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant
comes so near the heels of the courtier he galls his
kibe.--How long hast thou been grave-maker?
[Clown] Of the days i'th' year, I came to't that day
that our last King Hamlet o'ercame Fortiinbras.
[Hamlet] How long is that since?
[Clown] Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that.
It was the very day that young Hamlet was born--he into
that was mad and sent into England.
[Hamlet] Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
[Clown] Why, because he was mad. He shall recover his
wits there; or if he do not, it's no great matter there.
[Hamlet] Why?
[Clown] 'Twill not be seen in him. There the men are as
mad as he.
[Hamlet] How came he mad?
[Clown] Very strangely, they say.
[Hamlet] How, strangely?
[Clown] Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
[Hamlet] Upon what ground?
[Clown] Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton
here, man and boy, thirty years.
[Hamlet] How long will a man lie i'th' earth ere he rot?
[Clown] Faith, if he be not rotten before 'a die--as we have
many pocky corses that will scarce hold
the laying in--he will last you some eight year, or nine
year. A tanner will last you nine year.
[Hamlet] Why he more than another?
[Clown] Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade that
he will keep out water a great while; and your water
is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull
now. This skull hath lain i'th' earth tree-and-twenty years.
[Hamlet] Whose was it?
[Clown] A whoreson mad fellow's it was.
Whose do you think it was?
[Hamlet] Nay, I know not.
[Clown] A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A poured a
flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,
sir, this same skull, sir, was Yorick's skull, the King's jester.
[Hamlet] This?
[Clown] E'en that.
[Hamlet] Let me see. Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him,
Horatio, a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He
hath bore me on his back a thousand times; and how
abhorred in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here
hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft.--
Where be your gibes now? Your gambols? Your
songs? Your flashes of merriment that were wont to
set the table on a roar? No one now to mock your own
jeering? Quite chop-fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
chamber and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
favor she must come. Make her laugh at that.
Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.
[Horatio] What's that, my lord?
[Hamlet] Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fa
shion i'th' earth?
[Horatio] E'en so.
[Hamlet] And smelt so? Pah!
[Horatio] E'en so, my lord.
[Hamlet] To what base uses we may return, Horatio!
Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of
Alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole?
[Horatio] 'Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.
[Hamlet] No, faith, not a jot. But to follow him thither
with modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it, as thus:
Alexander died; Alexander was buried; Alexander
returneth to dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make
loam, and why of that loam whereto he was
converted might they not stop a beer-barrel?
Imperious Caesar, dead and turned to clay,
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
Oh, that that earth which kept the world in awe
Should patch a wall t'expel the winter's flaw!
But soft, but soft, aside! Here comes the King,
Enter King, Queen, Laertes, and a coffin,
with Lords attendant.
The Queen, the courtiers. Who is that they follow,
And with such maimèd rites? This doth betoken,
The corse they follow did with desperate hand
Fordo it own life. 'Twas some estate.
Couch we awhile and mark.
[Laertes] What ceremony else?
[Hamlet] That is Laertes, a very noble youth. Mark.
[Laertes] What ceremony else?
[Priest] Her obsequies have been as far enlarged
As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful,
And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
She should in ground unsanctified been lodged
Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her;
Yet here she is allowed her virgin rites,
Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
Of bell and burial.
[Laertes] Must there no more be done?
[Priest] No more be done.
We should profane the service of the dead
To sing sage requiem and such rest to her
As to peace-parted souls.
[Laertes] Lay her i'th' earth,
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
When thou liest howling.
[Hamlet] What, the fair Ophelia?
[Gertrude] Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife.
I thought thy bride-bed to have decked, sweet maid,
And not have strewed thy grave.
[Laertes] Oh, terrible woe
Fall ten times treble on that cursèd head
Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
Leaps in the grave.
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
Till of this flat a mountain you have made
To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head
Of blue Olympus.
[Hamlet] What is he whose griefs
Bears such an emphasis, whose phrase of sorrow
Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
Hamlet the Dane.
[Laertes] The devil take thy soul!
[Hamlet] Thou pray'st not well.
I prithee take thy fingers from my throat.
Sir, though I am not splenitive and rash,
Yet have I in me something dangerous,
Which let thy wiseness fear. Away thy hand!
[Claudius] Pluck them asunder.
[Gertrude] Hamlet, Hamlet!
[Horatio] Good my lord, be quiet.
[Hamlet] Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
[Gertrude] Oh, my son, what theme?
[Hamlet] I loved Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
Could not with all their quantity of love
Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
[Claudius] Oh, he is mad, Laertes.
[Gertrude] For love of God, forbear him.
[Hamlet] Come, show me what thou'lt do.
Woo't weep? Woo't fight? Woo't tear thyself?
Woo't drink up eisil? Eat a crocodile?
I'll do't. Dost come here to whine?
To outface me with leaping in her grave?
Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
Make Ossa like a wart. Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
I'll rant as well as thou.
[Gertrude] This is mere madness,
And thus awhile the fit will work on him;
Anon, as patient as the female dove
When that her golden couplets are disclosed,
His silence will sit drooping.
[Hamlet] Hear you, sir,
What is the reason that you use me thus?
I loved you ever. But it is no matter.
Let Hercules himself do what he may,
The cat will mew, and dog will have his day. Exit .
[Claudius] I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
We'll put the matter to the present push.--
Good Gertude, set some watch over your son.--
This grave shall have a living monument.
An hour of quiet thereby shall we see;
Tell then, in patience our proceeding be. Exeunt.
Enter Hamlet and Horatio.
[Hamlet] So much for this, sir. Now shall you see the other.
You do remember all the circumstance?
[Horatio] Remember it, my lord?
[Hamlet] Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly--
And praised be rashness for it!--let us know,
Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well
When our dear plots do fall, and that should teach us
There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
Rough-hew them how we will.
[Horatio] That is most certain.
[Hamlet] Up from my cabin,
My sea-gown scarfed about me, in the dark,
Groped I to find out them; had my desire,
Fingered their packet, and in fine withdrew
To mine own room again, making so bold,
My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio--
Oh, royal knavery!-- an exact command,
Larded with many several sorts of reason,
Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
That on the supervise, no leisure bated,
No, not to stay the grinding of the ax,
My head should be struck off.
[Horatio] Is't possible?
[Hamlet] Here's the commission. Read it at more leisure.
But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
[Horatio] I beseech you.
[Hamlet] Being thus benetted round with villains,
Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,
They had begun the play. I sat me down,
Devised a new commission, wrote it fair.
I once did hold it, as our statists do,
A baseness to write fair, and labored much
How to forget that learning, but, sir, now
It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
Th'effects of what I wrote?
[Horatio] Ay, good my lord.
[Hamlet] An earnest conjuration from the King,
As England was his faithful tributary,
As love between them as the palm should flourish,
As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
And many suchlike "as"es of great charge,
That on the view and know of these contents,
Without debatement further, more or less,
He should the bearers put to sudden death,
Not shriving time allowed.
[Horatio] How was this sealed?
[Hamlet] Why, even in that was heaven ordinate,.
I had my father's signet in my purse,
Which was the model of that Danish seal;
Folded the writ up in the form of the other,
Subscribed it, gave't th'impression, placed it safely,
The changeling never known. Now the next day
Was our sea fight, and what to this was sement
Thou knowest already.
[Horatio] So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
[Hamlet] Why, man, they did make love to this employment.
They are not near my conscience. Their debate
Doth by their own insinuation grow.
'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
Between the pass and fell incensèd points
Of mighty opposites.
[Horatio] Why, what a King is this!
[Hamlet] Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon?
He that hath killed my King and whored my mother,
Popped in between th'election and my hopes,
Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience
To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damned
To let this canker of our nature come
In further evil?
[Horatio] It must be shortly known to him from England
What is the issue of the business here.
[Hamlet] It will be short.
The interim's mine, and a man's life's no more
Than to say one. But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
That to Laertes I forgot myself,
For by the image of my cause I see
The portraiture of his. I'll count his favors.
But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
Into a towering passion.
[Horatio] Peace, who comes here?
Enter a Courtier [Osric].
[Osric] Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
[Hamlet] I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
[Horatio] No, my good lord.
[Hamlet] Thy state is the more gracious, for 'tis a vice to
know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast
be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the King's
mess. 'Tis a chough, but, as I say, spacious in the
possession of dirt.
[Osric] Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure,
I should impart a thing to you from his majesty.
[Hamlet] I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put
your bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
[Osric] I thank your lordship, 'tis very hot.
[Hamlet] No, believe me, 'tis very cold. The wind is
northerly.
[Osric] It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
[Hamlet] Methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion.
[Osric] Exceedingly, my lord, it is very sultry, as 'twere--
I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his majesty bade me
signify to you that has laid a great wager on your head.
Sir, this is the matter--
[Hamlet] I beseech you, remember.
[Osric] Nay, in good faith, for mine ease, in good faith.
Sir, you are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is at he
his weapon.
[Hamlet] What's his weapon?
[Osric] Rapier and dagger.
[Hamlet] That's two of his weapons--but well.
[Osric] The King, sir, hath waged with him six Barbary
horses, against the which he imponed, as I take it, six French
rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle,
hangers, and so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very
dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate
carriages, and of very liberal conceit.
[Hamlet] What call you the carriages?
[Osric] The carriage, sir, are the hangers.
[Hamlet] The phrase would be more germane to the
matter if we could carry cannon by our sides; I would
it might be "hangers" till then. But on. Six Barbary
horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three
liberal-conceited carriages: that's the French bet
against the Danish. Why is this "imponed," as you call it?
[Osric] The King, sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes
between you and him, he shall not exceed you three hits.
He hath laid on twelve for nine, and that would come to
immediate trial, if your lordship would vouchsafe the
answer.
[Hamlet] How if I answer no?
[Osric] I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person
in trial.
[Hamlet] Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please
his majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me. Let
the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the
King hold his purpose, I will win for him if I can; if
not, I'll gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.
[Osric] Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
[Hamlet] To this effect, sir, after what flourish your
nature will.
[Osric] I commend my duty to your lordship.
[Hamlet] Yours, yours. He does well to commend it
himself; there are no tongues else for's tongue.
[Horatio] This lapwing runs away with the shell on his
head.
[Hamlet] He did comply with his dug before he
sucked it. Thus has he, and many more of the same bevy
that I know the drossy age dotes on, only got the tune of
the time and outward habit of encounter, a kind of
yesty collection, which carries them through and through
the most profane and winnowed opinions; and do but blow
them to their trials, the bubbles are out.
[Horatio] You will lose this wager, my lord.
[Hamlet] I do not think so. Since he went into France,
I have been in continual practice; I shall win at the
odds. But thou wouldest not think how all here
about my heart, but it is no matter.
[Horatio] Nay, good my lord--
[Hamlet] It is but foolery, but it is such a kind of
gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman.
[Horatio] If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will f
forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit.
[Hamlet] Not a whit, we defy augury. There's special
providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not
to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it
be not now, yet it will come. The readiness is all, since no man
has aught of what he leaves knows. What is't to leave
betimes?
Enter King, Queen, and Lords, with other Atten-
dants, with foils and gauntlets, a table, and
flagons of wine on it.
[Claudius] Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
[Hamlet] Give me your pardon, sir. I've done you wrong,
But pardon't as you are a gentleman.
This presence knows,
And you must needs have heard, how I am punished
With a sore distraction. What I have done
That might your nature, honor, and exception
Roughly awake, I hear proclaim was madness.
Was't Hamlet wronged Laertes? Never Hamlet.
If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
Then Hamlet does it not; Hamlet denies it.
Who does it, then? His madness? If't be so,
Hamlet is of the faction that is wronged;
His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
Sir, in this audience,
Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house
And hurt my mother.
[Laertes] I am satisfied in nature,
Whose motive in this case should stir me most
To my revenge. But in my terms of honor
I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement,
Till by some elder masters of known honor
I have a voice and precedent of peace
To keep my name ungorged. But all that time
I do receive your offered love like love,
And will not wrong it.
[Hamlet] I embrace it freely,
And will this brother's wager frankly play.--
Give us the foils.--Come on.
[Laertes] Come, one for me.
[Hamlet] I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
Your skill shall like a star i'th' darkest night
Stick fiery off indeed.
[Laertes] You mock me, sir.
[Hamlet] No, by this hand.
[Claudius] Give them the foils, young Osric.
. Cousin Hamlet, you know the wager.
[Hamlet] Very well. my lord.
Your grace has laid the odds o'th' weaker side.
[Claudius] I do not fear it;
I have seen you both.
But since he is bettered, we have therefore odds.
[Laertes] This is too heavy.
Let me see another.
[Hamlet] This likes me well.
These foils have all a length? Prepare to play.
[Osric] Ay, my good lord.
[Claudius] Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire.
The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
And in the cup an union shall he throw
Richer then that which four successive kings
In Denmark's crown have worn.
Give me the cups,
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
"Now the King drinks to Hamlet." Come, begin.
And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
[Hamlet] Come on, sir.
[Laertes] Come on, sir.
[Hamlet] One.
[Laertes] No.
[Hamlet] Judgment.
[Osric] A hit, a very palpable hit.
[Laertes] Well, again.
[Claudius] Stay. Give me drink.
Hamlet this pearl is thine.
Here's to thy health. Give him the cup.
Trumpets sound, and shot goes off.
[Hamlet] I'll play this bout first. Set it by awhile.
Come, another hit; what say you?
[Laertes] A touch, a touch, I do confess.
[Claudius] Our son shall win.
[Gertrude] He's fat and scant of breath.
Here's a napkin, rub thy brows.
The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
[Hamlet] Good madam.
[Claudius] Gertrude, do not drink.
[Gertrude] I will, my lord,
I pray you pardon me.
[Claudius] It is the poisoned cup. It is too late.
[Hamlet] I dare not drink yet, madam;
By and by.
[Gertrude] Come, let me wipe thy face.
[Laertes] My lord, I'll hit him now.
[Claudius] I do not think't.
[Laertes] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.
[Hamlet] Come, for the third.
Laertes. You do but dally.
I pray you, pass with your best violence;
I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
[Laertes] Say you so? Come on. [They] play.
[Osric] Nothing neither way.
[Laertes] Have at you now!
In scuffling, they change rapiers.
[Claudius] Part them! They are incensed.
[Hamlet] Nay, come again.
[Osric] Look to the Queen there, ho!
[Horatio] They bleed on both sides. How is't, my lord?
[Osric] How is't, Laertes?
[Laertes] Why, as a woodcock
To mine springe, Osric;
I am justly killed with mine own treachery.
[Hamlet] How does the Queen?
[Claudius] She swoons to see them bleed.
[Gertrude] No, no, the drink, the drink.
O my dear Hamlet, the drink, the drink!
I am poisoned.
[Hamlet] Oh, villainy! Ho, let the door be locked.
Treachery! Seek it out.
[Laertes] It is here, Hamlet.
Hamlet, thou art slain.
No medicine in the world can do thee good;
In thee there is not half an hour of life.
The treacherous instrument is in my hand,
Unbated and envenomed. The foul practice
Hath turned itself on me. Lo, here I lie
Never to rise again. Thy mother's poisoned.
I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.
[Hamlet] The point envenomed too?
Then, venom, to thy work.
Hurts the King.
[All] Treason, treason!
[Claudius] Oh, yet defend me, friends, I am but hurt.
[Hamlet] Here, thou incestuous, murderous,
Damnèd Dane,
Drink off this potion. Is the union here?
Follow my mother. King dies.
[Laertes] He is justly served.
It is a poison tempered by himself.
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
Nor thine on me! Dies.
[Hamlet] Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
I am dead, Horatio. Wretched Queen, adieu.
You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
That are but mutes or audience to this act,
Had I but time, as this fell sergeant Death
Is strict in his arrest, oh, I could tell you--
But let it be. Horatio, I am dead,
Thou livest. Report me and my causes right
To the unsatisfied.
[Horatio] Never believe it.
I am more an antique Romaine than a Dane.
Here's yet some liquor left.
[Hamlet] As th'art a man, give me the cup!
Let go! By heaven I'll have't.
O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
Things standing thus unknown, shall I leave behind me!
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
Absent thee from felicity awhile,
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain
To tell my story.
March afar off, and shout within.
What warlike noise is this?
Enter Osric.
[Osric] Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
To th'ambassadors of England gives this warlike volley.
[Hamlet] Oh, I die, Horatio.
The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
I cannot live to hear the news from England,
But I do prophesy th'election lights
On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
So tell him, with the occurrents more and less
Which have solicited. The rest is silence. Oh, oh, oh, oh! Dies.
